Perception,"going weekly for the rest of the experimental arcs [ Woohoo!] starting this week. So, um, I guess actually we have an episode— I hope we don’t screw it up!"," Yeah, no, me too. I don’t know why you would even say that. Um, so, let’s get started! Monster of the Week is a game sort of modeled after, appropriately enough, like, monster-of-the-week shows like, uh, Buffy and Supernatural. In which, in each sort of arc, there is a monster that a team of hunters has to hunt down. It is a game that is part of the Powered by the Apocalypse system which, if you listen to the Balance arc, is sort of what I based the Stolen Century episodes on. It is a very— it’s sort of like the d20 system, right? That covers a lot of different games, like D&D and Pathfinder. Uh, it is sort of just like a broad rule set that you can put a bunch of different stuff on top of to make it fit whatever genre you want it to fit. And there’s a ton of very cool games that use the Powered by the Apocalypse system. Uh, I was inspired to do an Apocalypse game because of one of my favorite podcasts, Friends at the Table, which has done a bunch of really cool ones in sci-fi worlds and fantasy worlds and all kinds of stuff. But Monster of the Week is sort of this, this monster-of-the-week sort of horror but like, campy horror? Uh, thing that’s going on here? And the basic rule that covers pretty much everything in Monster of the Week and all the Apocalypse games, is that whenever something comes up that is not, like, an automatic thing, like is something that is dangerous or a conflict, or something that would be covered by like a D&D move, like, oh, you have to roll a perception check if you wanna actually notice that thing, all that stuff is in here, but instead of rolling a 20-sided dice, you roll two six-sided dice, and then one of three things happens. Either you roll a six or below, and you have fucked up. You have fucked up now. And something goes horribly wrong sort of at my discretion. I’ll be GMing this game, they actually call the GM in this game The Keeper which is, like, so great to me? That the fiction of the game extends out of the game, like, Stranger Things style. So, six or below is a miss. A seven to nine is a mixed success, where you get to do the thing you wanna do, but usually there is a cost. And then a 10 plus is “You crushed it,” and you get to do what you wanna do, and usually it’s just all great. ",Perception
Performance,"by, like, logic, you know what I mean? So I can’t be like, “I wanna Help Out by…” [inhaling sharply through teeth] Ssssssssssssss... Ooooh, logic. “...pulling the sun down.” Yeah."," [laughs] If you try to— if you try to play this like a game that you’re trying to win constantly, I do not think it’s gonna work. If rolls a six, and neither of you are, like, anywhere close to him, but you really wanna get him up to that seven, and so you’re like, “Ohhh can I think of some way to bullshit this so that it can help out,” like, no. There are going to be lots of failures in this game, and lots of mixed successes in this game, and that’s what makes this stuff, like, so, so interesting, and it’s what gives this game kind of a sense of danger. I don’t think that we’re gonna get to this point in this mini arc, but one of the things that I think is cool about this game is players, like… because of how narrow the margin of error is in fights, for instance, death is, like, pretty common. Not as much as some of the Lovecraftian RPGs where it’s like, “Oh no,” and then you are like, you evaporated again. But it is common, and there are systems for retiring your characters and rolling new ones and then giving that character over to the Keeper to use in whatever story in whatever way they want, which I think is really cool. and ",Craft
Investigation,"success, you open yourself up to repercussions. To, like, the same reper— so you can help out, yeah, but you are also exposing yourself to danger, which is real smart."," Uh, Investigate A Mystery, which is pretty much like your insight checks, your investigation checks. And what’s cool about that is what you earn when you get a 10 or above, or a 7 or 9, you earn what’s called Holds. And in Investigate A Mystery, the Holds will let you ask these questions, one Hold per question. ",Investigation

Perception,"play in the NFL!” and he was like “No.” There’s some really- we haven’t— I really like this idea of a Chosen that’s just like [crosstalk] “No, no thank you!”"," [crosstalk] “No, thanks.” I mean, that’s very, very, very cool from, like, my perspective, because then I have ways of, like, trying to tempt you into- we talked about this not going to be an ongoing, like, every episode Duck’s like “Ehhh, I dunno!” like, this is a story about this coming to a head. I wanna talk about about the moves really, really, really fast just to, like, highlight a couple of them in Duck’s, like, category, ‘cause this is what sold the game for me, were the playbooks and the special moves, ‘cause they are so perfectly tailored to hit this genre, and try to take the things that you, like, love about the characters in this monster of the week genre and turn them into game mechanics. So, like, the Chosen has a move called “The Big Entrance” where you make a showy entrance into a dangerous situation and, if you roll really good, everybody has to stop and listen to your speech. [ laughs] Like, it’s a way of, like, setting up different scenes in the way that you want them. There’s… ",Listen
Medicine,"you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting. That’s definitely this. Um. Yeah so- but if it’s Weird, I rolled an eight plus two so it’s a 10."," Okay. I think with a plus 10, you contain the fire. You see it start to retreat off the edges of the curtain, that sort lines the back of this room, and sort of retreat off the ceiling a little bit where it had started to spread. It’s still definitely burning somewhat, but you get the sense that you have essentially like, saved this building. Um, I will also say that the fire and heat and smoke of this situation is now powerful enough that it’s becoming kind of unbearable to be in this place. But with your control, you controlled the fire, you almost spoke to the fire and made it calm, somewhat. You have saved this building from being completely destroyed, but if you stay here any longer it’s going to be bad for your health. Aubrey",Heal
Perception,"booze in a Arnold Palmer. I mean, sometimes there is. Arnold Palmer loves to party. [ and laugh] That's true, yeah. [chuckles] Sometimes there is booze in an Arnold. [Laughter]"," He walks over to the desk and you all now seated at this large table in the center of the room. He rolls out a big map of Kepler, which I still need to generate. Hey, listeners!

[crosstalk] Mmm, interesting."," An interesting concept. Uh, you mark exp. You also hear the door to the main office here open up, and you see Todd with one of his nudie magazines rolled up and he's got it kinda in his armpit as he walks in trying to hide it. And he walks into the room and sees you and the raunchy mag falls to the ground dramatically in slow-motion. And he says",Hide
Athletics,"he’s kind of leaning backwards, shooting at the snake along the length of its watery body, and basically heading towards one of the big water slides, just away from them."," Here’s what happens. You do this sick dodge roll out of the way and the snake rolls past you, and now you’re sort of running parallel alongside it as it continues its trajectory past you, just firing bolt after bolt into its side. It takes 2 harm, and one of the bolts, I think, hits it close to its head, and as that happens, you see the snake form, just for a moment, kind of spasm, and a bunch of water sort of shoots out of the side of it, almost like it had this surface tension containing all of it that it just sort of loses at a few points, and water just spills out of it. And you manage to get past it, but it does a quick u-turn, you know, 30 feet behind you, and then starts chasing you towards the water slides. The water slides at the back of the park, there are three main, large water slides. They are all built into the same tall wooden tower, with staircases leading up it, with a line sort of separated into three parts where people, you know, wait in line and then get to the slide that they want to go on and disembark from there. But it’s all part of this one central structure, and you run towards that direction. And it is gaining on you and gaining on you, and right as you hit the pool at the base of this water slide structure, it finally catches up to you and collides with you, knocking you forward. The tremendous force, though, of this thing just barrelling to you, hits you and knocks you into the water for 2 harm. And it continues its path and sort of travels over you as you are now in the pool, not unconscious like your friend Duck but sort of dazed from the force of the impact. And as you look upwards, you see the snake start to lift up and away from the surface of the pool, and it begins to climb this wooden tower, this tower of slides. And then you see the water from the pool that you’re actually in start streaming upwards, like a, like a sink faucet that’s been left on, and it’s pouring water upward and out of the pool. And then you see a few more appear, and then dozens more, until like a hundred streams of water are pouring upward as this snake starts coiling around this wooden tower, just twisting all around it, weaving between the stairwells leading to its peak, and soon the water from the pool floats up and joins it, and now it’s no longer a snake coiled around this wooden tower of slides. Now it is just a mountain of water, just completely engulfing the whole structure. You can see sort of silhouetted from the floodlights shining into this mountain of water from behind, you see pieces of the slides start to break apart. {50",Climb
Medicine,"I just think it’s information we need. ’s gonna Investigate a Mystery. Ok. And… Roll plus Sharp. [ rolls] That’s very bad. [quietly] Shit. You did a bad job, Dad."," rolled a five. There is no recovering from that. I’m going to take a hard move here, the hard move is that the goatman that is embedded in the roots of the tree— I will call him “shears goatman”— starts to move. And he sort of wrestles with these roots that are all over him, and he pulls himself out of the roots and tree. As he emerges from the tree, you realize that he has merged with this white bark. It is growing out of him, now. It is forming around his spine like a brace. You get the impression that this thing probably broke its back when Aubrey flung him against a tree and now the tree has healed him in a way by giving him this external chitin made of this white bark, but it has like corrupted him in a way, it’s sticking out in this huge gnarled lump that extends just over his head, and his eyes are clear white. And he picks up his shears, and starts walking towards you, . Uhhh… Aubrey! ",Heal

Athletics,"Yeah, I love it. Mark Luck, and you have spent one Luck. Hey, and I wanna do a cool line. Yeah, yeah, do a cool line. Aubrey Fuego, ya bastard!"," The monster lands on the floor with this walking stick in its throat, just kind of barely emerging from its mouth, and Aubrey, you’re laying on the floor right in front of it, and you just sit up and you grab the walking stick with your hand and we see it glow, and as it glows a bright orange, I think the chamber goes silent as we watch the inside of this monster glow; softly at first, and then brighter and bright orange, and then, in a spray of black mist, the beast explodes. And as it explodes, I think all three of you are flung backwards, away from the beast as this wave of force shoots out at you, and Aubrey, because you were right up against the wall, I think you smash up against the wall again, and you bang your head again, and as you land on the floor, you roll a couple feet as you bounce off of it. The scene around you just kind of starts coming to you in flashes. You see Duck and struggle to climb to a kneeling position, you see the smoke that was filling this chamber is spreading much faster now, this fire has grown wild, and the smoke is filling your lungs, and now you’re kind of unable to catch your breath, and in another flash, you look toward the mouth of the cave, and you see that wall of fire still roaring high, and as your vision finally fades, you see a figure appear in the fire. You see a large woman wrapped in her duster leaping through the flames in your direction, and then you lose consciousness. {Ad break 53",Climb

Thank you all so much for listening to The Adventure Zone episode 19, the second part of our newest story arc. Uh, it’s- it’s good to have you here! I hope you’re havin’ a good Thursday. I wanna take a break from the show real quick to tell you about some of our sponsors this week, like, for instance, One Month! One Month is an online service that teaches you how to code, and all kinds of online tech skills that you’re gonna need to survive, in the upcoming techno-pocalypse. One Month students learn to code by building real websites and apps, growth hacking their businesses and websites, and building payment systems and security solutions. One Month’s courses are the easiest way to learn these new tech skills. Uh, it’s called One Month and it’s 15 minutes a day, for 30 days. That’s nothing! Everyone has 15 minutes to kill, every day, for a month, at least. You can enroll now at onemonth.com/adventurezone. Enrollment is typically 99 bucks but if you join now, you will receive your first month, with One Month- your first One Month period- for 25 percent off! That’s a crazy, g- deal.

Again, go to onemonth.com/adventurezone and save 25 percent. I have two personal messages here, you can get a personal message on the show by going to maximumfun.org/jumbotron and telling them that you want to purchase a spot on The Adventure Zone.

Hope you have a great dirty 30 birthday, and I hope this message from your favorite McElroys brightens your day like Taako the wizard brightens our lives.” Uh, they asked for this around July 4th, which is her birthday- And what a great birthday to have, you get drunk, you eat hot dogs, you watch ID4, and then you get drunk again, but this time for your birthday! I think that sounds like the best day ever, Maxine I hope it was real special. Here’s our second message, it’s for and it’s from Tom. Tom says to , “Happy one year anniversary, my love. You mean the world to me and I love you so much. I can’t wait for what the next year will bring with you. Here’s to a lifetime of wonderful memories.” There is nothing toooo, make fun of. In that message. Nothing to goof about, it’s just so sweet, that I started to get a little bit faint? So I’m going to drink some of this goji berry juice, and reconstitute myself… And I’m back. Uh, congratulations to and Tom, it sounds like you both found some… Some love, in a hopeless place. Or maybe a hopeful place, I don’t- I don’t know where you live. Congratulations, though, for real.

History,"claim me, Merle, and you use me, you can stop yourself from grabbing it. You can be whole again, Merle, that is--that is my offer to you. [The Chalice plays]"," Um, so Taako, you are with June and the Temporal Chalice in the white space, and I’ve kind of described what the scene is so our radio audience didn’t have to listen to it a second time. But you’re in this white space and you are sort of scanning through the memories of your life. And at first the scan is kind of going back day by day, and then week by week, and then month by month, and you’re seeing sort of recent history play out all around you. So like you’re standing in the Crystal Kingdom lab in the Cosmoscope, you’re looking into the different planar mirrors, and then all of a sudden you’re standing in front of a cherry blossom tree in the middle of Goldcliff and your arm is on Magnus’s shoulder and then you rewind a bit faster and you’re taking a job, in a tavern in Phandalin. And you’re just sort of scrolling back through the history of your life. And where the memories are, um, a little less memorable things get a little bit blurrier. When it’s things that you’ve just kind of forgotten there’s just static. And while June is scrolling back through your life, and through the years preceding the adventure that this podcast has sort of contained, she hits a long, long, long period of static that she seems to just sort of look around kind of quizzically during, and she’s just like fast forwarding, or I should say rewinding, faster and faster and faster, and then once she gets past this long static the picture returns and you find yourself standing in your early adulthood and adolescence. And this brings me to my first question of, like, stuff I want to dive into with Taako, and that is",History
Athletics,"we die and we come back to life, no big deal. Merle [crosstalk] Yeah. Magnus [crosstalk] Oh hold on! No, well-? Taako Let’s do it! And I hit the lever."," Okay, yeah, you hit the switch and the hatch over Shaft A closes over the bubble that was placed there and the hatch into Shaft B opens up. Uh, and while Shaft A was kinda like a straight shot down, it’s like that was where they found the original motherload of diamonds and they just bored right down into it, Shaft B you can see is kind of more of an exploratory shaft. Like they were using Shaft B to look for where more diamonds might be? And so the cart track that you’re standing on goes into that shaft and kind of spirals all the way around it, branching off into little tunnels here and there as these tunnels were sort of them just looking, just trying to find more as they go. It kind of looks like a roller coaster down there of minecart tracks. Um, and as you open up that shaft, there’s a small hole sort of at the start of the track and four minecarts roll out into them. Um, and Roswell doesn’t hesitate for a second. Roswell runs and jumps in one of the cars and says",Jump

Roswell manages to sort of, like you said, like, retract itself, so Roswell manages to get in, but it’s not like, a clean entry? Roswell loses some clay, like, their legs and their leg armor and the clay that was on their legs just gets like - knocked off as it get caught in the tracks. But Roswell pulls themself off, and you see some of their torso siphon down and form new legs, but there’s no armor on them, there’s no armor on them at all. And the bird on Roswell's shoulder, like, it looks completely frazzled right now.

So, you all aren't seeing this; Taako, Merle and Magnus aren't seeing this, this is just sort of like a shot in the movie that the audience is seeing. And what we're seeing is a disheveled study of somebody who's preparing for something big. It's somewhere underground; there's a chill in the air, permeating these wet stone walls, and the room is lit by several dozen candles, which are all arranged around a desk, which is piled high with magical tomes and piles of maps. Behind that desk is a large wooden board that is displaying a map of the whole of Faerûn, the continent that this story takes place on, and there are strings connecting images and diagrams at certain points on the map, like Phandalin and Armos and Greenhold and Rockport and Goldcliff and Neverwinter. And all these different cities are sort of connected by this web of strings and pictures and diagrams. And it's the board of somebody who's been tracking the Relics and the Bureau intently. Other than the candles there's another source of light in this room, which is a six-foot-tall glowing pod that stands on the opposite end of the room from the desk, and it's full of a swirling green liquid, and inside we can see something growing, or rather, someone growing. There's a body being created inside of this pod, but the liquid inside is too opaque for us to see who it is. And the last thing we see is the desk again, and there's a scroll that is unfurled and held in place by four candles, one at each corner, and this scroll is an incredibly detailed map with a route drawn through it in red, and it is a map depicting, with perfect accuracy, the headquarters of the Bureau of Balance.

Uh, and then the three of you with Killian and a worse-for-wear Gundren Rockseeker entered the vault in the middle of Wave Echo Cave uh- uh, not before Taako finds a powerful umbrella-shaped staff on a skeleton wearing a red robe. Uh, inside that vault you find a gauntlet which Gundren takes as his birthright but it grants him a fiery power that he seems incapable of controlling. He flies from the room. You pursue him to Phandalin, stopping a convoy of orcs slavers, uh, and you free Kurtze, who is a young orcish boy, who uh- who’s campment had been destroyed by Gundren. Um, uh, you rescue him from a cage, although he leaves without thanking you. In Phandalin, Barry warns you that Gundren has grown too powerful before Gundren, who is now just made of living fire, destroys Barry Bluejeans. You nearly talk him down from his rage but Kurtze, in retribution, shoots him with an arrow from outskirts of town. You three and Killian dive into a well at the last second as Gundren goes thermonuclear and Phandalin is reduced to a circle of black glass. Killian explains that she represents an organization designed to stop these things from happening and enlists you after you are able to reclaim the gauntlet, uh, without falling prey to its thrall. Killian summons a glass spherical vehicle from the sky which you ride up to a hole in the moon. [Music stops] ",Ride

Insight,"questions here that we can sort of address this at— Rob asked, and this is something that was got from a lot of folks in a lot of different iterations"," “A lot of discussion on popular TAZ internet forums lately have been focused around the actual play component of TAZ and whether or not that has or should take a backseat to the more narrative-driven aspects of the show.

Perception,"Maybe it is. Maybe I'll meet someone that can help me with this. Give it to , he'll read it for you.[laughter] Yeah, you know. Oh man. Yeah, that's ."," Excellent. No, that's fantastic. I'm really excited about getting into this. I think we have a good trio on our hands. Of course, since y'all all have your different backstories, y'all are all going to kind of meet at Strumlott's. You won't really know each other, so that's going to give y'all the opportunity to kind of parse things out. Get to know each other, and figure out who each other are. So, you know, that'll be where our first episode takes us. Before we get into this, I just want to say a couple of things for those who may have not played DnD before. Pretty much what we're going to do is each of our player characters have a character that has different modifiers based off of their stats, like strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Those are your base stats that affect all of your abilities and skills. So what they'll do is they'll roll a twenty-sided dice, and that's pretty much your standard dice you're going to roll. Your weapons may have different damage, like some swords do a d6, others a d8, but yeah, so they'll be rolling that, and we'll have them- We're going to try to have them state their full roll. Like list the d20 roll then add their modifier.Aside from those dice, we're also going to be rolling- We're going to try to write a song for y'all pretty much every episode. So and everything in those songs will be made up on the spot. We'll take a minute, you know, write up the lyrics, and we're going to keep that also in the aleatoric essence of the game, and roll chord dice that bought. Pretty much there's just seven chords on an eight-sided dice, and there's a wild one, we haven't figured out what we're doing there yet. But yeah, we're going to roll those, and they're going to take the chords that they're given and write a song appropriate to the scenario going on. Other than that, I guess we should go ahead and get rolling.[Music plays to indicate the beginning of the adventure] ",Spot

Floating above Mr. Alfonso, however, you find a very tall, gangly, pale blue humanoid creature enshrouded in a long black cloak like smoke. He has this pale blue skin and a long black-nailed claw is outstretched over the top of Mr. Alfonso's face and he is sucking some sort of blue light, absorbing it from Mr. Alfonso's mind into his hand. And even though, with such an amazing Stealth roll, you know you can't be seen, you see the creature give just a slight crick of its neck towards your direction.

And while this console does not give you complete control over the building as a whole, it does allow you certain permissions within this area.

Investigation,very sheltered life in the barracks. 1021 All I've known is the Boros. 1023 'I play the drums on the drummin' the face.' 1028 Boom Boom to the face. 10,"30 So based on your rolls, you all probably have different levels of understanding about a current situation at hand. Although, baseline, you all would know that recently within Ravnica, there have been rail lines being constructed in an attempt to create some sort of mass transportation system. Lavinia breaks it down a little bit more and says, ""The Guildpact has many different purposes. Sure, it protects Ravnica from all-out guild war, but one of its purposes is to protect the guilds from interfering into each others' businesses. The Rakdos are not going to create a court system anytime soon. The Golgari are not likely to suddenly enter into banks and loans. However, there is no transportation market at the moment. Which means the first guild to complete its trans-Ravnican system will immediately monopolize the market under the protection of the Guildpact. There are four lines up for contention at the moment. The Boros Legion is building one for military transport. We at the Azorius Senate have cast our lot in with them. The Izzet League are certainly not wasting an opportunity to invent something. Although what the Firemind's intentions are, we do not know, which is why your little vedalken friend is currently under detainment. Now the Golgari Swarm apparently is building one underground, and they seem to be making a great deal more progress than the other three. I certainly look forward to having a conversation about that, under-citizen. As for the fourth, it is not guild-affiliated. A couple of wealthy private citizens are doing their damnedest to keep the transportation market out of guild control. I am not concerned about that one. It is the other three that are causing a problem. You see, the three guild lines have converged on a piece of Simic property where our research facility happens to lie. Zonot #4 is a medical station built in an underwater sinkhole. But the Simic Combine is not involved in the rail war, nor do they intend to. If we do not play this carefully, they will reject anything we propose, assuming that we are part of some sort of rail war plot. But we need to get Elasia to that research facility. This is where you come in. If my justicar was to bring a member of each of the contending guilds, along with the Selesnyan emissary, we might be able to convince them that our goal has nothing to do with the rail conflict. And we can get exactly what is inside of Elasia's head. You will take her to Zonot #4, you will retrieve what is inside her head or I promise you catastrophe is on the horizon."" ""Yes, ma'am.""

And you can see behind his shield he has a bunch of collection of potions, scrolls, various things. He pulls out two common healing potions, hands them both to you and says, ""Standard issue. Here you go."" And he says, ""And also, here is one of these."" And he hands you a scroll. And from his back he pulls out a coil of rope. He says, ""As the captain always says, 'always carry rope.'""

Performance,is not good. 1338 This is the kind of thing that should be banned in Ravnica. 1341 That is the opinion of a Selesnyan. 1343 Yes! Andrew 1345 Guildpact. 13,"46 Guildpact. For those of you whose characters are old enough to remember... One of you. In history, you would have heard the tale, very recently, within the last 70 years of when the demon Rakdos reawoke and saved the city from like a massive kaiju attack. The Cult of Rakdos is mostly in control of mining and smelting within the world of Ravnica. They also manage a great deal of day labor and cheap labor. On top of also controlling a good portion of the entertainment areas of Ravnica that is sort of balanced with the Orzhov who controls some of the more seedy aspects, prostitution and the like. The Rakdos are given free rein to have these performances based on the rules of not only the Guildpact, but also because attendance is voluntary, although it is not unheard of to hear people being kidnapped and forced into these performance. A common trope within the Rakdos is, 'it's not fun and games until someone loses an eye.' And now just a quick word from one of our sponsors. Andrew 13",Performance

In history, you would have heard the tale, very recently, within the last 70 years of when the demon Rakdos reawoke and saved the city from like a massive kaiju attack. The Cult of Rakdos is mostly in control of mining and smelting within the world of Ravnica. They also manage a great deal of day labor and cheap labor. On top of also controlling a good portion of the entertainment areas of Ravnica that is sort of balanced with the Orzhov who controls some of the more seedy aspects, prostitution and the like. The Rakdos are given free rein to have these performances based on the rules of not only the Guildpact, but also because attendance is voluntary, although it is not unheard of to hear people being kidnapped and forced into these performance. A common trope within the Rakdos is, 'it's not fun and games until someone loses an eye.' And now just a quick word from one of our sponsors. Andrew 13",Balance

And our thanks to Twenty Sided Store in Brooklyn, New York for supporting this and every episode. Their co-owner, Bilanko, is our resident master Dungeon Master. We bring her your D&D questions just like this one. How do you handle players who like to make multiple skill checks in a row after they fail the first one? Master Dungeon Master says, “Get in the habit of always asking your players to first describe what they're doing and how they plan to do it. Then you can choose the appropriate skill for them to roll to accomplish the task and to role-play the outcome. So, if a bard for example is trying to persuade the guard and that didn't work, the difficulty class would definitely go up if the bard immediately then try to intimidate the guard. You can also let your player know how difficult the role is going to be and describe the possible outcomes of both a success and a fail. So, when the bard rolls low, they have to role-play what happens next. Whether you're a DM or a player, you'll find what you need at Twenty Sided Store.

History,"home. We also have the Punchbowl, an interview series with people pushing D&D forward creatively, communally and socially. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com. Transcript"," Hey, hi, hello, Join The Party listeners. It’s me, . And it’s just gonna be me. If that freaks you out, turn it off right now. I’ll give you a second to wait for it. Alright, well the rest of you who are staying... [laughs] So we’re in the in-between-times between campaign one and campaign two. I can’t believe that the Concentric States arc is over and now we’re doing this other thing. I don’t think I’ve prepared creatively for anything else I’ve ever done in my life more than I have for this Join The Party thing. So I’m ready. I’m so excited to play. You’re gonna be- it’s gonna be great. But, in the meantime, we did say we were gonna have some one-shots and I thought this would be a great time for me to go onto itch.io - for those of you who don’t know, it's like a tabletop and games compository - that's not a word, but you know what I’m talking about - where you can find indie games and just buy them and pick them up. So I heard about this recommended on ‘Friends at the Table’ and this is from the Emotional Mecha Game Jam. So they do Game Jams where people just kind of make up games or - as quickly as possible - and this was for the Emotional Mecha one. Basically, the Emotional MechaJam people put together games that were about mechs and feelings, and this is one of the games that came out of it. So me, by myself, am going to - I am going to play the game ‘Plot Armor’ by a game designer called DC. So I’m going to walk you through this and then we’re going to play the game, and then we’ll see what happens. So you can also buy this. We’ll have the link in the episode description, and it’s seven dollars. Just pick this up. Games are worth your money. Independent game people are worth the money. I have never felt this more than speiding all the time and energy editing and formatting, and sourcing that we did for the Labor Party modules. I’m like - it’s not even that much! You can just buy - you’re giving me money for the things that came out of my brain? That sounds great! And I’m really excited to support a game designer like this, and we’re going to play ‘Plot Armor’ together. So for those of you, I guess who have met me in person, I’m a big fan of, like, the anime-mecha genre. I think this comes from ‘Friends at the Table’. I like the idea that people go into mechs and it’s emotional, and it’s big robots fighting is wild. I’m not like an anime fan all that much, like I’ve watched some. I used to watch Toonami back in the day and I kind of housed all of ‘My Hero Academia’. So some of these tropes I don't know as well, but of course I play tons of games, and I watch tons of TV shows and I read all of this stuff, so I think this is a fun exercise for me to kind of stretch into it. And I am kind of making a robot-mecha anime as we go along. The way that this game is paced is that you're a pilot who is looking back on his life as a pilot of a mech and you're writing journal entries about it. So all I really need is a journal, which I have my microphone right here and listening to me, so every so often my journal is going to slightly titter back at me if I make a joke, which is good or not. And then I need one d6, so I have my dice right here and you can hear that now. [rolls die]. Did you hear it? Did they hear it? says they heard it, which is pretty good. So I had everything that I need right here. So let’s get started. Plot Armor is a single player RPG about perception, truth, and fate. Your character is the protagonist of a 32-episode mecha anime. I looked on the website and it said that the optimal game is 24 episodes, so I think I’m gonna do 24 episodes because I am worried about speaking all of this into existence. During these 32 episodes, or 24 episodes, your protagonist will slowly come to realize that reality is not what it seems. They have Plot Armor, which is the ability to survive any and all situations that they may face due to being the main character of the story. However, your protagonist will unknowingly die at the end of Episode 32, or 24 in my case. So let’s talk about the setting. You can choose any setting for your 24 episodes, as long as they contain the following. 1) There is a mecha known as Armor, so the mechs are known as Armor. There will be mech fighting or conflict. There will be unimaginably difficult situations to escape or overcome without immense luck and/or impossible skill. And there will be a hot springs episode which is optional. ’s looking at me weird. A ‘hot springs’ episode is where everyone just kind of hangs out at a hot spring. It’s like in between the season you want just the people talking to each other, but they’re outside of the mech and people don’t fight. They just hang out literally at a hot springs. The mech- [laughs] just asked me if the mech was nude and… I would say no. No one is necessarily nude, I think. It’s also kind of funny, it is gendered in that way. It’s like the boys talk to each other and the girls talk to each other. Sometimes they talk to - but it’s fine. This is funny, doesn’t know anything about anime, so it’s funny. Um, let’s see. Let’s talk about the setting. I was thinking that the setting… because it can be any sort of anime I want as long as it has those things, it uses mechs and they're called armor. I feel like, and this might be from watching ‘His Dark Materials’ with so much, but I like the idea that at some age, the people in the world get mechs- like it’s very much like a bar mitzvah. It’s a symbol that you’re an adult. And I think there must be some sort of compulsory draft or something. I know they still do a draft in Israel that as soon as you turn 18, you can do - have to do anything, but of course things in the draft you might not necessarily be fighting, you can do all this stuff. So I think there might be something about there being a country that has a compulsory draft because - and when you are a teenager, you get a mech -it’s like the mech finds you, so I feel like… I wonder how they get- I wonder how they get the mechs. See this is the thing about me is that I get lost in - in plot. I get lost in plot so much. Maybe like when you’re 13, your birthday present is you go to the mech - like the mech department store. Maybe it’s like Robots-R-Us or, um… it must be like more - because I think in my head it’s very clinical. It’s like yes this is what happens. You know, when you first get to the point where your doctor starts asking you if you are having sex. And then like those [laughs] laughed because I said sex. Um, when you have different questions and you're responsible for your own body and stuff, so I feel like this is similar. It must be like an institute. It’s like the Robotics Institute of this country. And they have a- like you spend five years getting used to your mech. And I think your mech is probably has some sort of like pleasing version, because it very much like in ‘His Dark Materials’, the animal or the daemon finds you and matches your personality. So the mech has some sort of like randomly generated AI personality and also turns into some sort of animal or something that can fit - maybe probably fits in a backpack, and then of course when it activates, it’s a mech suit, and you can put it on and it is similar to the small version. Like that’s the name of your - that’s the name of your mech is a nickname or something related to the animal you have, so like if you have a dog and it had a spot on it, your mech - it’s like this is my mech Spot. And then even when you're in there that’s like your callsign because the person and the mech are the same. So I think that’s interesting and then they are fighting, if it’s a compulsory draft, I think this is one of those - like ‘Ender's Game’ style, they're just like fighting aliens or like Halo, like when you can - for those of you who play video games, it’s like when you play Halo for the first time and you have to convince your parents because it’s M rated, and it’s like no we’re killing aliens it’s fine! Or like in ‘Enders Game; they were fighting some just like enemy out there and I think it has to be like that. I wonder if there’s - there’s another thing where you are just like - like the fighting of the aliens, has to do with this. Or similar - I guess similar to ‘Arrival’ how just like the aliens show up and you just, and they just need to deal with it and there's perpetual conflict which I think stokes a lot of this, whatever neo-country we’re living in. It can be like the neo-United States honestly like what if in 19- or like 2005, no probably earlier like in 1991, because that's when I was born, all of a sudden aliens just started coming down an there was a mech program and then all new children had to - it could be like in the DC area even - all children that turn thirteen now go to the Robotics Institute and get their mechs at thirteen and then you learn - you get used to them for five years then you go off and fight or do whatever you have to do in the army. I also like that it’s thirteen, because this is something that I’m very fascinated with history, is that ages, or people, or like reasons are so arbitrary, so maybe like the director of the Robotics Institute or the Robotics Program is just Jewish, and they're like “Hey when should people start getting mechs?” and it’s like “Thirteen, that’s when the Bar Mitzvah is.” I just kind of like that a lot. Let’s see - the protagonist. So I just did a lot of world-building, congratulations . [laughs] Uh, I think there’s also something interesting about fighting an immobile thing, so maybe they come down like asteroids, like as an asteroid belt sort of thing. Like people are shooting asteroids at the United States and you’ve gotta like blow them up. That may be good. And then there are things inside of the asteroids which might develop over the season. I think that’s interesting. Um, so you’re - the mech is the 18-year-old children go up into space and fight with the mechs that they've come to love over five years. Um, protagonist, so let’s go to the next part. What’s important about creating your protagonist is their mecha show archetype. The reluctant hero, an emotional genius, completely inexperienced but full of heart, the child prodigy, for honor and/or country, to end suffering, and a foolish perception of being a pilot. These archetypes are not binding as your character may hit more than one during play, but consider theme is an optional foundation for what to build off of as well as the potential moments in your character’s story. The one I’m really drawn to here is “Completely inexperienced, full of heart.” In my head, I like - and this is from ‘My Hero Academia’ - is that like the new normal is having superpowers in that anime, but in this one the new normal is getting the robot but its like there needs to be a heavy process about being chosen, but - So maybe they go to the Robotics Institute - the robotics where the mech - the Armor Warehouse? Yeah, it’s like Men’s Wearhouse, Armor Warehouse, or the Armor Institute, maybe Armor is some sort of arcane initialism. And they go down there when they are thirteen and no mech suit chooses them. I think there’s some idea like this is your - like who is supposed to be a representative of you and there has to be - either is literally like the mech chooses you or there’s the metaphorical the mech chooses you, and it just doesn't happen. It’s like he goes back to his mom and his mom’s like “Oh what mech - what's in your bag” like the children all have backpacks, like that’s where you keep your mech, and of course he comes back and the backpack isn't full. So maybe and it’s like he’s a - it has to be, it’s always a guy in these - in mech anime unfortunately so I think it has to be a dude here. And he’s just like, “Yeah I didn’t find one. It didn't choose me.” And they just didn't have a mech in there of our problems, because of course like they get bullied - like middle school and all that stuff for not having a mech. And maybe, I don't know, they like got beat up after school and - actually no maybe I should save this for the first episode. I’m gonna save this, I have some ideas. I’ll come back to this. So let’s start by playing a game. We’re gonna get started. So we’re gonna begin on Episode 1. I’m going to pick an arbitrary awesome-sounding star date to track time with. And title your episode as such. Their example is 12A-B011-XX, Where It All Began. Episode 1. Your first episode must include the following plot points",History

I also like that it’s thirteen, because this is something that I’m very fascinated with history, is that ages, or people, or like reasons are so arbitrary, so maybe like the director of the Robotics Institute or the Robotics Program is just Jewish, and they're like “Hey when should people start getting mechs?” and it’s like “Thirteen, that’s when the Bar Mitzvah is.” I just kind of like that a lot. Let’s see - the protagonist. So I just did a lot of world-building, congratulations . [laughs] Uh, I think there’s also something interesting about fighting an immobile thing, so maybe they come down like asteroids, like as an asteroid belt sort of thing. Like people are shooting asteroids at the United States and you’ve gotta like blow them up. That may be good. And then there are things inside of the asteroids which might develop over the season. I think that’s interesting. Um, so you’re - the mech is the 18-year-old children go up into space and fight with the mechs that they've come to love over five years. Um, protagonist, so let’s go to the next part. What’s important about creating your protagonist is their mecha show archetype. The reluctant hero, an emotional genius, completely inexperienced but full of heart, the child prodigy, for honor and/or country, to end suffering, and a foolish perception of being a pilot. These archetypes are not binding as your character may hit more than one during play, but consider theme is an optional foundation for what to build off of as well as the potential moments in your character’s story. The one I’m really drawn to here is “Completely inexperienced, full of heart.” In my head, I like - and this is from ‘My Hero Academia’ - is that like the new normal is having superpowers in that anime, but in this one the new normal is getting the robot but its like there needs to be a heavy process about being chosen, but - So maybe they go to the Robotics Institute - the robotics where the mech - the Armor Warehouse? Yeah, it’s like Men’s Wearhouse, Armor Warehouse, or the Armor Institute, maybe Armor is some sort of arcane initialism. And they go down there when they are thirteen and no mech suit chooses them. I think there’s some idea like this is your - like who is supposed to be a representative of you and there has to be - either is literally like the mech chooses you or there’s the metaphorical the mech chooses you, and it just doesn't happen. It’s like he goes back to his mom and his mom’s like “Oh what mech - what's in your bag” like the children all have backpacks, like that’s where you keep your mech, and of course he comes back and the backpack isn't full. So maybe and it’s like he’s a - it has to be, it’s always a guy in these - in mech anime unfortunately so I think it has to be a dude here. And he’s just like, “Yeah I didn’t find one. It didn't choose me.” And they just didn't have a mech in there of our problems, because of course like they get bullied - like middle school and all that stuff for not having a mech. And maybe, I don't know, they like got beat up after school and - actually no maybe I should save this for the first episode. I’m gonna save this, I have some ideas. I’ll come back to this. So let’s start by playing a game. We’re gonna get started. So we’re gonna begin on Episode 1. I’m going to pick an arbitrary awesome-sounding star date to track time with. And title your episode as such. Their example is 12A-B011-XX, Where It All Began. Episode 1. Your first episode must include the following plot points",Perception

Find out more at jointhepartypod.com. Transcript"," Hey, hi, hello, Join The Party listeners. It’s me, . And it’s just gonna be me. If that freaks you out, turn it off right now. I’ll give you a second to wait for it. Alright, well the rest of you who are staying... [laughs] So we’re in the in-between-times between campaign one and campaign two. I can’t believe that the Concentric States arc is over and now we’re doing this other thing. I don’t think I’ve prepared creatively for anything else I’ve ever done in my life more than I have for this Join The Party thing. So I’m ready. I’m so excited to play. You’re gonna be- it’s gonna be great. But, in the meantime, we did say we were gonna have some one-shots and I thought this would be a great time for me to go onto itch.io - for those of you who don’t know, it's like a tabletop and games compository - that's not a word, but you know what I’m talking about - where you can find indie games and just buy them and pick them up. So I heard about this recommended on ‘Friends at the Table’ and this is from the Emotional Mecha Game Jam. So they do Game Jams where people just kind of make up games or - as quickly as possible - and this was for the Emotional Mecha one. Basically, the Emotional MechaJam people put together games that were about mechs and feelings, and this is one of the games that came out of it. So me, by myself, am going to - I am going to play the game ‘Plot Armor’ by a game designer called DC. So I’m going to walk you through this and then we’re going to play the game, and then we’ll see what happens. So you can also buy this. We’ll have the link in the episode description, and it’s seven dollars. Just pick this up. Games are worth your money. Independent game people are worth the money. I have never felt this more than speiding all the time and energy editing and formatting, and sourcing that we did for the Labor Party modules. I’m like - it’s not even that much! You can just buy - you’re giving me money for the things that came out of my brain? That sounds great! And I’m really excited to support a game designer like this, and we’re going to play ‘Plot Armor’ together. So for those of you, I guess who have met me in person, I’m a big fan of, like, the anime-mecha genre. I think this comes from ‘Friends at the Table’. I like the idea that people go into mechs and it’s emotional, and it’s big robots fighting is wild. I’m not like an anime fan all that much, like I’ve watched some. I used to watch Toonami back in the day and I kind of housed all of ‘My Hero Academia’. So some of these tropes I don't know as well, but of course I play tons of games, and I watch tons of TV shows and I read all of this stuff, so I think this is a fun exercise for me to kind of stretch into it. And I am kind of making a robot-mecha anime as we go along. The way that this game is paced is that you're a pilot who is looking back on his life as a pilot of a mech and you're writing journal entries about it. So all I really need is a journal, which I have my microphone right here and listening to me, so every so often my journal is going to slightly titter back at me if I make a joke, which is good or not. And then I need one d6, so I have my dice right here and you can hear that now. [rolls die]. Did you hear it? Did they hear it? says they heard it, which is pretty good. So I had everything that I need right here. So let’s get started. Plot Armor is a single player RPG about perception, truth, and fate. Your character is the protagonist of a 32-episode mecha anime. I looked on the website and it said that the optimal game is 24 episodes, so I think I’m gonna do 24 episodes because I am worried about speaking all of this into existence. During these 32 episodes, or 24 episodes, your protagonist will slowly come to realize that reality is not what it seems. They have Plot Armor, which is the ability to survive any and all situations that they may face due to being the main character of the story. However, your protagonist will unknowingly die at the end of Episode 32, or 24 in my case. So let’s talk about the setting. You can choose any setting for your 24 episodes, as long as they contain the following. 1) There is a mecha known as Armor, so the mechs are known as Armor. There will be mech fighting or conflict. There will be unimaginably difficult situations to escape or overcome without immense luck and/or impossible skill. And there will be a hot springs episode which is optional. ’s looking at me weird. A ‘hot springs’ episode is where everyone just kind of hangs out at a hot spring. It’s like in between the season you want just the people talking to each other, but they’re outside of the mech and people don’t fight. They just hang out literally at a hot springs. The mech- [laughs] just asked me if the mech was nude and… I would say no. No one is necessarily nude, I think. It’s also kind of funny, it is gendered in that way. It’s like the boys talk to each other and the girls talk to each other. Sometimes they talk to - but it’s fine. This is funny, doesn’t know anything about anime, so it’s funny. Um, let’s see. Let’s talk about the setting. I was thinking that the setting… because it can be any sort of anime I want as long as it has those things, it uses mechs and they're called armor. I feel like, and this might be from watching ‘His Dark Materials’ with so much, but I like the idea that at some age, the people in the world get mechs- like it’s very much like a bar mitzvah. It’s a symbol that you’re an adult. And I think there must be some sort of compulsory draft or something. I know they still do a draft in Israel that as soon as you turn 18, you can do - have to do anything, but of course things in the draft you might not necessarily be fighting, you can do all this stuff. So I think there might be something about there being a country that has a compulsory draft because - and when you are a teenager, you get a mech -it’s like the mech finds you, so I feel like… I wonder how they get- I wonder how they get the mechs. See this is the thing about me is that I get lost in - in plot. I get lost in plot so much. Maybe like when you’re 13, your birthday present is you go to the mech - like the mech department store. Maybe it’s like Robots-R-Us or, um… it must be like more - because I think in my head it’s very clinical. It’s like yes this is what happens. You know, when you first get to the point where your doctor starts asking you if you are having sex. And then like those [laughs] laughed because I said sex. Um, when you have different questions and you're responsible for your own body and stuff, so I feel like this is similar. It must be like an institute. It’s like the Robotics Institute of this country. And they have a- like you spend five years getting used to your mech. And I think your mech is probably has some sort of like pleasing version, because it very much like in ‘His Dark Materials’, the animal or the daemon finds you and matches your personality. So the mech has some sort of like randomly generated AI personality and also turns into some sort of animal or something that can fit - maybe probably fits in a backpack, and then of course when it activates, it’s a mech suit, and you can put it on and it is similar to the small version. Like that’s the name of your - that’s the name of your mech is a nickname or something related to the animal you have, so like if you have a dog and it had a spot on it, your mech - it’s like this is my mech Spot. And then even when you're in there that’s like your callsign because the person and the mech are the same. So I think that’s interesting and then they are fighting, if it’s a compulsory draft, I think this is one of those - like ‘Ender's Game’ style, they're just like fighting aliens or like Halo, like when you can - for those of you who play video games, it’s like when you play Halo for the first time and you have to convince your parents because it’s M rated, and it’s like no we’re killing aliens it’s fine! Or like in ‘Enders Game; they were fighting some just like enemy out there and I think it has to be like that. I wonder if there’s - there’s another thing where you are just like - like the fighting of the aliens, has to do with this. Or similar - I guess similar to ‘Arrival’ how just like the aliens show up and you just, and they just need to deal with it and there's perpetual conflict which I think stokes a lot of this, whatever neo-country we’re living in. It can be like the neo-United States honestly like what if in 19- or like 2005, no probably earlier like in 1991, because that's when I was born, all of a sudden aliens just started coming down an there was a mech program and then all new children had to - it could be like in the DC area even - all children that turn thirteen now go to the Robotics Institute and get their mechs at thirteen and then you learn - you get used to them for five years then you go off and fight or do whatever you have to do in the army. I also like that it’s thirteen, because this is something that I’m very fascinated with history, is that ages, or people, or like reasons are so arbitrary, so maybe like the director of the Robotics Institute or the Robotics Program is just Jewish, and they're like “Hey when should people start getting mechs?” and it’s like “Thirteen, that’s when the Bar Mitzvah is.” I just kind of like that a lot. Let’s see - the protagonist. So I just did a lot of world-building, congratulations . [laughs] Uh, I think there’s also something interesting about fighting an immobile thing, so maybe they come down like asteroids, like as an asteroid belt sort of thing. Like people are shooting asteroids at the United States and you’ve gotta like blow them up. That may be good. And then there are things inside of the asteroids which might develop over the season. I think that’s interesting. Um, so you’re - the mech is the 18-year-old children go up into space and fight with the mechs that they've come to love over five years. Um, protagonist, so let’s go to the next part. What’s important about creating your protagonist is their mecha show archetype.

It’s like he goes back to his mom and his mom’s like “Oh what mech - what's in your bag” like the children all have backpacks, like that’s where you keep your mech, and of course he comes back and the backpack isn't full. So maybe and it’s like he’s a - it has to be, it’s always a guy in these - in mech anime unfortunately so I think it has to be a dude here. And he’s just like, “Yeah I didn’t find one.

And maybe, I don't know, they like got beat up after school and - actually no maybe I should save this for the first episode. I’m gonna save this, I have some ideas. I’ll come back to this. So let’s start by playing a game. We’re gonna get started. So we’re gonna begin on Episode 1. I’m going to pick an arbitrary awesome-sounding star date to track time with.

Athletics,"to 20 Sided Store in Brooklyn New York. And Get 20% off using the discount code JOINTHEPARTY, in store or online. Alright, let’s get back to the show. [transition noise]"," Alright, let’s see what Sunset does. So this is where I figure out what to do next. So once you feel that you've covered that episode fully, which I think I did. I feel like I’ve talked for a long time there, which is funny because this is a podcast where it’s just me. Uh, once I’ve covered that episode fully, I roll my d6. I’m going to take that result and add that to the number of your current episode number. So if I rolled a four and I was on episode one, I’m now on episode five. And then et cetera. So once you know what episode your next journal entry is, you roll your d6 twice for one of the following sections to decide what happens to your protagonist and what happens to your armor. So- and I’m going to talk about chronicling the episode. So while chronicling each episode, I’m going to tell the story of whatever time skips might happen. This can be due to episode jumps or even my moving the star date forward by choice. Episode 24 can take place ten years after Episode 1 or ten days. Once you're finished chronicling the episode, I’m gonna roll our d6 again and choose the prompt for the next episode. I can interpret the prompt in any way that makes sense to me. Each one of these episodes will bring my protagonist closer to realizing they are an invincible impossible being. When they become sure of this truth and in what context is up to you. And then I’ll get to my finale as I get there. So I’m gonna roll... [rolls die] Oh I rolled a six! So now I’m on Episode 7. Alright, so this is gonna be forward just one season. So this is AFS52 Twilight, Episode 7 and it’s called “Flight School Showdown.” I’m going to roll for my d6… [rolls die] I got a 3. I went berserk and slayed a friend and foe alike. And then the armor… [rolls die] Is a 2. It temporarily transformed. Okay. So this is already on Episode 7, so I think we’ve kind of already established this person getting the - Sunset Park getting his friends and all the other misfits, and all the misfits coming together. And they also like suspect that Sunset is a- they probably suspect that Sunset is a like - the... amazing at what they do. And they - Sunset just doesn't actually have any sort of control over the mech, it’s like the mech does things quicker than even Sunset - but like when they have to make an emotional choice, that’s when the person inside of the armor is like... They’re starting to quintessentially embody what it is- armor for so many other people I think is controlling it, but I think this all-black armor… I wonder what he names it. It probably is something… maybe it’s just like Midnight. Yeah, the armor is named Midnight. Because it doesn't have an animal name. Like he - Sunset has to tell people that it’s a black cat, but of course it’s just a rolling ball, so I think this is the flight show. Immediately Sunset is drafied into - is immediately drafted because at his regular high school, he's just excelling far beyond everyone’s wildest things, and of course he can't do it, but he doesn't want to disappoint his teachers and his mom, and he wants to be better than all the bullies who bullied him, so I think he went immediately… there’s like a flight school, like he got drafted early, and of course it’s like hand waved of why a fifteen-year-old- why a fifteen-year-old is now in flight school immediately. So I think he has a show-down where he’s challenged by like a hotshot who has a - I literally think he has a duck, a duck armor. And he has very big wings and aggressive mouth, like pincers when he turns into a mech. Most of the armors I guess they have jets, but I like that this one has literal wings, which makes him fly faster. He’s like more aerodynamic. He’s using the - what was it - what’s a duck name? I think it’s named Quack. Like Quack is the flight school bully and Sunset is going up against Quack and they're doing like - there’s a… I think there’s a series of challenges and I think this is where it picks up in the beginning.

Perception,"the entire podcast. That’s sure true! And I’m like, well! The entire water filling the workshop trap…totally biffed it. Here’s an amazing item I came up with. [ chuckles] Like…congratulations."," Speaking of, this is from The Spammy on Twitter, is there anything that anyone wished happened a bit differently? Like if you could go back and change something, what would it be? As simple as taking one more bagel? Laughing/crying emoji. Or something more dramatic? I do wish that I just, like, rolled Perception in every room until is forced to give my something interesting every time. [ and laughing] Uh…or like rolling for food and just like finding food somewhere. I, going back, would do more lawls. ",Perception
Perception,[ laughs] Do you have some sort of DM table with interesting books? I always blank when people ask to search for books in my libraries. Says Tobias. [ chuckles]," I…I’m just a big idiot and I really keep forgetting that libraries are things that have a lot of titles. [ laughs] I guess I have to say it’s also like a simple, an easy plot device and an easy way to communicate secrets or like information. So, it can be like a stat boost like the Roboman C books that they found. It can be like a piece of information. Like what Inara looked for stuff on Cronopolis. Libraries have EVERYTHING. So you can put whatever you want in the library. Um you can also have different types of libraries. We had like a personal library. We had the one in the university that Tracey went to and Chad scared off all of the terrible librarians who were running around. You can have like an archive, like what we had at the end of Hunting Party. So, just like, libraries are good places to like learn information, and D&D's all about learning information. So it’s more like communicating what you want to get across and like you can have them roll to do a Perception and figure out what they get. You don’t need a table, just make things up if you want them to get something nonsensical. But if you want to communicate plot, have a title. Give them something. ",Perception
Persuasion,"a DM. Because it really brought together all the skills that I've learned over the course of playing this game. I voiced about 200 [laughing] NPCs. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."," And I also am learning when you guys want to do something, I raise the stakes. Like I don't say no, but it's like you guys need to roll really fucking well. And I said, I wanted to be clear about it, I'm like, this is DC 18, it needs to be Persuasion. You need to make it, obviously, double or nothing. I mean, we've talked about what DCs mean. And like, a DC 18 or DC 20 is like heroic, but you are convincing someone who doesn't want to do something to do the thing. You have to go double or nothing here. Like The Speaker offered you six votes, but you decided to try to push for seven. And I'm like, you know what, if this is parliamentary procedure of the highest level, like fantasy parliament, I don't know like, you have to go double or nothing. But I'm glad that I gave you the opportunity. And like I would have entertained however it went. ",Persuasion
Perception,"Franny looks at you and says, (as Franny) Uh, blueberries are a superfood. So...gotta keep it tight. Inara nods and sits at the opposite end of the table. [ chuckles]"," Okay, so as you guys are going back to your table, why don't you both make Perception checks? [both roll dice] ",Perception
Perception,"loose Initiative. So that I know, who, in what order you guys are checking your stuff out. I’m going to roll for Oatcake. [all roll dice] [intense chords] 3! 15!"," Okay, so Inara, before you can pull your shadow cowl, you hear Oatcake poof in another room.

Perception,"you did it so well, I'll make you a role a Dexterity roll to see if you can get into the room and check anything out. [dice rolls] Uh, 7."," Okay, with a 7, you cannot check out anything more but you - you are now safely in Room 9 so you don't have to interact with anyone else but you have not been able to check anything else out. Okay, it is now Oatcake’s turn. I'm going to see what else she can check out. [dice rolls] Okay. Inara, I want you to make another Perception check to see where Oatcake is. [dice rolls] ",Perception

Acrobatics,strip mall in which the Electroshack is stationed. (as Tracey) [screaming] LEFT!!! LEFT!!! PIVOTTT!! (as Inara) Which left Tracey?! We've been over this!! (as Tracey) [still screaming] THE ONLY LEFT!!!," Casey looks up from the circuit breaker which is underneath the front counter and slams his head, as always, and dazed, comes up above and sees Tracey and Inara pushing this oversized hamster ball containing a beautifully coiffed young man and an exact replica of that beautifully coiffed man, but created entirely out of crackling energy. Alonzo has been frequently banging on the walls of the anti-magic bubble trying to get out, while also trying to keep his feet. As you've been pushing him from Jersey Mike's Arena back to the Electroshack, while the replica of Alonzo created entirely in light, is just like keeping his footing? As you roll, he takes one patient step forward. And even as you jostle him from left to right, he always holds his balance. (as Alonzo)",Balance
Perception,"vision of it gets like a little wobbly. And as you step closer, closer to it, you're like 5 feet out and then you feel something cold. I look down.", It doesn't look like anything’s there. Why don’t you make a Perception check? [dice rolls] ,Perception
Insight,"love to play it if you...don't mind. (as Joshua) [robotically] I'm no good at games. I'm clumsy! From my hands. (as Inara) Oh. Joshua, your hands look super...average to me."," Uh, why don't you make an Insight check? [rolls dice] ",Insight
Perception,"machine, out here? Yes, there is a claw machine over next to the prize station. If I rummaged through the sides of my pack do, I have any tickets left?"," You don't have any tickets. But if anyone wanted to - wanted to make a Perception check, maybe you might be able to see some tickets. ",Perception
Athletics,so you’re supposed to ring a duck. Yes. Yes. So Tracey reels back with the mightiest might that he can muster and rolls… [dice rolls and then laughs in response]," Alright, Inara, I want you to roll as well. Tracey, if you're going to hit it as hard as you can do Athletics. [dice rolls] ",Athletics
Persuasion,"But you can put the scapegoat down on the ground. As soon as it touches the ground, it turns into a regular size goat. And it does goat things. Yesss."," But if you blame anything on the goat, everyone needs to make a Persuasion check of over 14... ",Persuasion
Stealth,"titans follow behind. From up in the rafters, cloaked in shadow, Inara aims, the neutralizer squarely at Alonzo's back.

Stealth,"I'm going to continue to advance toward the ring. So, I want to be like within 10 feet, but definitely a different angle. And shoot Alonzo again with the neutralizer."," Okay, I want you to make another Stealth check. [dice rolls] ",Stealth
Stealth,"the other direction from underneath the ring. Come out that side and then get up into the ring, behind the barrel as cover, and then attack the guy that way."," Okay, great. So why don’t you make a Stealth check to see if you can sneak up on these guys. [dice rolls] ",Stealth
Perception,"make a Stealth check to see if you can sneak up on these guys. [dice rolls] [whispers] Oh, nice! [ gasps] Good dice! 16 for Stealth. [ & imitate airhorns]"," Yeah, okay. These titans are not smart. They don't really hear you as you're scrambling under. They're more focused on the glowing barrel and in their midst and you can sneak up behind them. Tracey, I want you to make a Perception check while you're sneaking. ",Perception
Athletics,"tummy rub? On your turn you can use an action to try to interact with said giant Oatcake. So now, the dog is going to do some destruction! [dice rolls]"," Alright, I rolled a nat 20. No one is nat 20 luckily. So, the dog with nat 20 though, is going to just jump around and run directly through one side of the stadium and I need everyone to make Dexterity saving throws.

Stealth,"thing. Heck yeah! Inara it is now your turn. So, for my action, I'm going to take one more shot at Alonzo. Okay. [ rolls dice] What am I rolling?", This roll is for your Stealth. You need to continue to stay stealthy. Up on the catwalk. ,Stealth

Investigation,"like this is mood lighting of his aura. Alright. While I'm this close, do I notice anything? Is he wearing any kind of battery, or tool, or necklace, or anything?"," Yeah, sure. The entire time the medallion is spinning. Which is odd because of the amount of, you know, how gravity works and how that would be super strange. You also - I want you to make an Investigation check. [ rolls dice] ",Investigation
Investigation,"40 feet, so I think he probably is up with them, right? Yeah. You are like crowding the grappler and the barrel at this point. You can't do much, yeah."," So now it's back to the doges turn, so I'm going to roll again [ rolls dice] Okay, I rolled an 8. So, with an 8, the dog realizes that the Council of Bright is really not gonna do anything fun for it. So, it decided to run and play around instead and it runs through the stands and searches, just like bashing bleachers and seats everywhere. So, I need everyone to make to make a Dexterity saving throw. [Everyone rolls dice] ",Search
Acrobatics,"[disappointed] It’s a 10… No, no! My mojo! It took your mojo away! What if I did like a front flip and then shot him. Then could I use acrobatics?"," Alright. If you get above a 20 for your acrobatics roll, I will give you advantage so you can roll your ranged again. ",Acrobatics
Stealth,"and columns and… Yeah, yeah. Like cutting through air. Like a ship. [laughing] I don’t know why that got me. That’s very good. Like a clipper sailing through the wind!"," It's good. Alright, so give me a Stealth roll. [ rolls dice] ",Stealth
Deception,"pull things off of the wall in the dressing room. And you just have a smelter, like in the corner, that you pull out of the closet. I mean obviously."," Obviously. And then you beat it down with a giant hammer, it gets super-hot, and it glows red, and you have your goggles on. And every so often you see Tracey like in the background being like, [high-pitched cheer] “Yeah, great, alright, yay!” There are a bunch of games of Inara playing with a shield golem. Which I think, it just cuts to that and it’s very slow going. I want you to do a Deception check, but I want you to use your - add your proficiency bonus because you’re proficient in making stuff, but this is like you’re making a lie. So, I will say you have +7, so I will give you 2 more cause this is your literal job. ",Deception

Athletics,and everyone will just pretend that they knew about it and then think that they forgot? (as Kohl) I think I have an idea. [short pause] [metallic foreboding music begins]," Three hours later, the city is reeling from the surprise blackout. an Inara and Kohl, you plastered the neighborhood with hastily drawn but intricate posters advertising the match of the millennium, “See Kohl, The Infernal, and the Midnight Man in an empty arena match for the ages”. And the poster depicts Kohl and a purply black silhouette, charging each other in a shadowy stadium and an explosion where the two characters meet. Inside of Jersey Mike's Arena, Alabaster and Tracey are rolling a barrel of Undying Light to center stage. Kohl warms up while Inara holds a piece of paper with Franny’s instructions on how to set up the secret weapon. As she slots the cartridge into a cobbled-together looking unit, a spark jumps up and singes her fingers. I guess it's good luck. Across town in a dark room, the medallion starts to spin. And the Midnight Man wakes up. [metallic foreboding music stops] [theme music] ",Jump
History,"played Dungeons and/or Dragons. [ gasps excitedly] How did it stack up? Mike It felt great, my first 3 rolls were fucking dope! [ laughing] You rolled very well! Mike", I did until I had to do my history checks. I was not good at them. ,History
Investigation,"really but I can make myself look different and my clothes look different. Oh, Cool. The cape spin was just flare. [ & laughing] , what does the text say?"," You make yourself including your clothing, armor, weapons and other belongings on your person look different, until the spell ends or until you use your actions to dismiss it. You can seem one foot taller or shorter and appear thin fat or in between. But you cannot change your body types, you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you, and you do a Investigation check against your spell save DC to figure it out. ",Investigation
Perception,"hear, there are crowds that are lined up outside of the arena, like kind of tailgating before the game. [gasping] What are they making?! Yeah, what are these dope snacks?"," Uh, why don’t you both make Perception checks? And I’ll roll for Oatcake. [dice rolls] ",Perception

This week’s question comes from Zoe, who asks, “I’m running a game where there is a lot of GM work. How do I balance knowing everything about all the factions and fronts and background complications required by the game with in-the-moment play with my players?” says, “Spend several sessions with your players developing their characters and their backstories. Introduce the locations that their PCs would know from the start, and world build with your players to discover what they are most interested in. Break down the information needed to run the campaign into parts, deciding what will come up in the first session, second session, and so forth. On a small notecard, jot down a couple bullet points to easily reference during the game and focus on the overall story. Anything else you can't remember in the moment, make up, then jot down in case it comes up again later.” Thanks, Master Dungeon Master!

It’s short, and sometimes it has a leap year, which only reminds you are bad at keeping track of time. So, I say, in this February, just lean into what you love about winter. Wear all of your layers, buy an extra fuzzy blanket, make hot chocolate, or mochas, or hot toddies like every day. This is the winter of your content. Welcome to the midroll. Ohhh look at all the marshmallows! Hello, hello to our newest patrons! Davin, Maria, Melissa, Jacey Blake, LeedaMaria, Desmond, Noah, Pip, and Blair. You are the torch in the light cave.

If you want to be the more things in our pack, like an enchanted dagger, or compass, or all of that dang rope, you can join up at patreon.com/jointhepartypod. We are sponsored this week by Shaker and Spoon. Shaker and Spoon is the best cocktail box that only requires that you get alcohol, and they bring everything else. So, this is a time where I update you on all of ’s fancy bar stuff. He now has a sideboard which is kind of like a bar-cart, and it is extremely fancy. It even has a tiny pedestal where he keeps all of his tiny bitters and stuff. And I don’t have any of that so whenever I go and see it, I always go, Ahhh biz, look at your cool tinctures and then shakes his head, and goes, no that’s incorrect. I need some support to class up my drinking situation, so I turn to Shaker & Spoon. They give you all of the unique supplies to make amazing drinks, and it’s enough to make 4 cups of 3 separate cocktails. All you need is the alcohol, and a reason to make some drinks, which you could probably just make up, just say you made it through the day, and that is enough. Go to shakerandspoon.com/jointheparty and get $20 off your 1st box. That is so much off! Seriously, the boxes are like 50-40-50 dollars, so, that’s like almost 50%, I mean, I don’t know any math, but sounds pretty good.

I have three words for you. Golden. Girls. Clue. Now, we all love Clue because it gives us a reason to accuse our friends of MURDER, and some of us dearly love the Golden Girls. A sitcom all about older women who crack wise and learn to live together. What would happen if you combine the two? Now this isn’t just some novelty retread, the game actually leans into the silliness of the Golden Girls. We’re looking for a misplaced cheesecake. And you can be distracted by men and shiny things as you play the game. It’s a literal mechanic. In Clue! B. Arthur is there! I don’t know what else you need. Whether you are a Blanche, a Dorothy, a Sophia, or a Rose, you can get your games and puzzles and many many more things at Twenty Sided Store. You can visit them online at twentysidedstore.com or in person in Brooklyn, New York. Just use our discount code, JOINTHEPARTY for 20% off. That is twentysidedstore.com, and use our discount code, JOINTHEPARTY. And if you made it this far in the midroll, we would really appreciate it if you recommended us to a friend this week. The best way to grow the podcast is to getting a heartfelt recommendation, so we need our listeners to go out spread the good word. You can do it in person, via text, on an awkward facetime with your parents where they’re holding it sideways but you’re holding it up and it really doesn’t sync up. You can spray-paint it on an unused billboard. Or you can use it on an opening line on a dating app. It’s really happened before, it really works. Just tell someone about Inara, Tracey, Oatcake, and everyone else. We’d really appreciate the help- [Mellow elevator music begins] ",Listen

And he throws it in the air and catches it, and throws it in the air and catches it, and he throws it in the air, and suddenly the unicorn jerks forward. It stumbles into Alonzo’s room just uncontrollable and it just keeps stumbling around and just smashing into all of his furniture.

You remember a bunch of mythology stories where he’s kind of like a half-trickster and he puts on this disguise of an old man to trick people into doing what he wants. And you remember three things about Ze’ol from these stories about him. One, he loves to put on this old man disguise because it makes people seem more vulnerable so he can take advantage of them when he wants to. The second thing is Ze’ol loves jokes and he loves laughing at his own jokes.

So, having a ton of, you know, dice rolls or banter among the players, like it’s nice to hear people on podcast that feel like they’re friends and feel like I am one of their friends too, but there becomes a point where that is like off-putting to outsiders. Like I didn’t listen to McElroy podcasts for a long time because I was like, “I think they’re doing a bit, but I don’t know,” and you just don’t you know. You have to really get the humor in order to get the humor, and so it can be hard to start.

[sound of industrial machines inside] On the other side of the building, like just stuck to the side of it is a cute French style boutique hat shop that is just all white accents and it’s just Baroque and Rococo as fuck.

Athletics,"the live show, it seemed like it was pretty straightforward. I did not have a resolution for how you were supposed to bring down the Zaratan. Love it. Oh, classic."," However, you did it, and if it made sense and you made the rolls, that was how you were going to do it. I had some ideas, like a definitely put the slide whistle in there, and I figured you were going to Prestidigitate it to make it louder, but out’s like you could have done anything. You could have gotten Inara’s cousins to help. You could have jumped down and used the forest. You could have tried to do some other magical stuff. You could have tried to kill it if you really wanted to. It would have been really difficult, but you could have tried. So, giving yourself room to improve is just as good as having 5,000 notes of DM prep. Michael",Jump

Jury’s out."," Well it’s funny that you say that, because this leads right into a question from our discord, from Raccoon Danny- thank you so much, Danny. This is a question for DM , but I’m also gonna ask some stuff about this because the question is, “What are your original intentions with Oatcake?

The party moves onto their second mission"," dealing with the lackadaisical Zubi, so they cross back to the ruined city. How do you get inside the mind of someone who can’t control their own thoughts? Inara remembers the mind-reading potion she made back in Kiko Castle and drinks it to communicate with the stone giant. He’s startled by the clarity of her presence and delicately holds her in his hands without turning her to stone. Zubi explains that the Bone Whale appeared out of nowhere and the sheer insanity of its existence broke his fragile mind. With a calm and steady voice, Inara talks him down and brings him back to reality. He points her towards the Bone Whale’s hideout - the cave that used to be Zubi’s home, flooded by diseased water. The four adventures step inside of the dank and strange cave, looking for any sign of the bone whale. Unfortunately, in the haste of Zubi’s escape, he didn’t disable his traps. The party evades rolling boulders, a fiesty ooze and a timed closing door to come face-to-face the Bone Whale. Making matters worse, Jamie is stuck inside the whale’s rib cage, struggling to escape. Johnny fires eldritch blasts at the Bone Whale, bearing the brunt of its anger and damage. Inara hops from shadow to shadow with her magical cowl. She sets off a trap that crushes the monster under a pile of boulders and teleports into the ribcage to grab Jamie. The Bone Whale rages at Johnny in its damaged state and knocks him out. In the midst of the commotion, Alonzo fires a “cursed arrow” as a killing blow. As he celebrates, brackish water floods the entire chamber. Everyone tries to swim out to the river outside the cave, except for Johnny. In his unconscious state, he finds himself in the full glory of the Undying Light. He asks for guidance in a world of darkness, and The Undying Light cryptically advises him to keep following his path. In a flash, the Light cleanses the river of the Bone Whale’s diseased aura and washes Johnny onto shore. Soaking wet but alive, Inara and Tracey stumbleupon Johnny’s body and hurriedly try to revive him. As they do, Johnny glows brighter and brighter, like wood catching fire. All of a sudden, Johnny bolts up and hops to his feet. Johnny is okay, though strangely a foot shorter and missing a shadow. Antipolis, for the time being, is safe, thanks to these jailbirds and the young champion. What awaits them next, my children, is another story.",Swim

Hi Jeffrey! So Jeff is here to be our… oh, he took out my DM- the very old DM’s guide, I like that. I won’t do anything bad, I promise.

Medicine,and this is a two-sided axe and there are snakes that curl around the handle- Neat! And go up above the axe. Neat! They’re named Macaroni and Cheese. [ gasps]," Oh, that’s good! I like that! And both sides of the axe have little red crosses on them. And this is called the Sawbone. [ and laugh] The Sawbone is a two-handed axe and you can wield it as a regular axe, but this has a very special quality, it actually can heal people. You need to convince your patient to stay still, and then this does 1d10 damage, so you roll a d10, and then you’re going to heal them for 1d20 damage. ",Heal
Intimidation,"[ giggling] Just bouncing it around in his hands like- Michael (as Johnny) Uh, Kevin, how'd you like that earlier fall? How about you step back before you fall again?", Why don’t all three of you make Intimidation checks? [dice rolling twice] ,Intimidation
Arcana,"a lot over the last few days, and Tracey, I just wanna get a hand on what is happening here. Michael Hey, am I passively sensing any kind of magic?", Why don't you make an Arcana check? Michael,Arcana

Perception,"and I think it’s something that like I feel like almost D&D has like a bad rap, because I guess when i had heard of it- It’s devil worshipping. Mike"," [laughing] Yeah. Just like when I was younger and heard about it I was like, “Oh that’s like that super duper nerdy game where you roll dice and stuff.” I didn’t understand the storytelling element to it. And if when I was younger it was framed to me as “No, no, no it’s basically creating a story with your friends and you have to roll dice to keep it going,” if it like- I guess my perception of it was the flip was that it was mostly dice rolling and like fighting with warlocks and elves and stuff which never appealed to me, hence not reading ‘Harry Potter’ or watching ‘Lord of the Rings’ or all that kind of stuff. But if someone flipped it and was like “A. It doesn’t necessarily have to be that. And B. It’s more of like storytelling with a hint of dice rolling,” then I would have been way more on board, so now that I guess I’ve seen it- like my introduction to it is through podcasting where obviously it’s storytelling is the main emphasis behind it, then I think that kind of opened my eyes to it to be like, “Oh wow, you can take something that is traditionally very nerdy and hardcore and is supposed to be really difficult or whatever, but it’s just like fun to listen to.” I think you can listen to ‘Join The Party’, you can listen to ‘The Adventure Zone,’ you can listen to all these other Dungeons and Dragons podcasts, and know nothing about D&D and have no interest at all in D&D but still be like, “Oh wow! That was super fun to listen to!” Like at the end of the day you’re just making like a fun story with your friends, and if it was marketed to me as that earlier, I totally would have done this when I was in high school or whatever.

Perception,"Great. Michael And since I’m the last one in and I don’t really want to do this, I pull the emergency brake off. [faint music begins with long breathy notes]"," Okay, here’s how this works. There are a few different speeds that you can do. You are stopped at the moment, and you can go slow, medium, fast, and then over that is fast and out of control. Every round, you can either lean into this hill, which makes you go one step faster, you can stay as you are, or you can use the emergency brake to try to slow yourself down. We’re gonna do this in Initiative rolls. Each round, you guys are all gonna roll a Perception. [deeper bass notes join the music] Think of it as like a constant trap. On a certain initiative, something is going to happen, and you need to do the amount of Perception to, like, avoid it. Then those who notice roll Initiative to see who reacts first to the feature. Johnny, as you let the emergency brake go, the cart slowly goes forward, and it starts with a small screeching sound as it starts to move. [electric melody joins the music] Michael",Perception
Perception,just falls out of the thing because he’s going too fast. Michael Johnny is going to murder both of his companions and make this cart go as slow as possible.," I mean, it seems like it’s two against one, so for this round you guys are gonna go faster.

Perception,"Sneak Attack every time it comes up, so- I will say this ‘til the day I die Rogues are haaaaaaaard. [laughing] Thank you. Rogues are secretly the hardest non-magic users."," By now, it’s both getting to know our dynamic as players and getting to know the game. Something that I really appreciate that did as the DM early on for me is when he said, “What do you wanna do?” and I just looked at him blankly, he came back with, “Okay, so you can do, you know, one of three things.” And when I needed it, he was able to extend to me, like, “Well okay, so you’re in the dungeon, and you can go down the hallway, you can go back into your cell, or you can, you know, look around and see if there's other things you aren’t aware of yet.” And so until I was able to ask things, like- it took me maybe 15 sessions to remember that I can do checks. Like I can do Perception checks on places. Like I just kept forgetting. And so I would see and Fish do them and be like, “Ah shit! That’s right. I forgot.” Or I, you know, wouldn't use my items, or I forgot that I had abilities to do things in combat that weren’t just like punch and stab. So, just for me that kind of menu of options. I kept looking down at my character sheet and being like, “I don’t know what’s here.” So something Fish did for me is make a Mage Hand magic card, like he has spell cards for all of his spells as Johnny and made one for me for Mage Hand, so in combat, maybe it’s having a few flashcards in front of you and being like, “I can run away, I can punch, I can stab, I can use my longbow, or I can do Mage Hand,” if you have a cantrip, whatever. So just making more concrete instead of just an open world wherein you can do whatever you want whenever you want, and you have to... you know- it felt to me like I had to be way more creative than I was able to be. Having discrete options that I can choose from and then incorporate into the role play was for me really huge, so giving your players perhaps the benefit of the doubt for a second- they might be a little bit overwhelmed. And giving them options or asking, “What is challenging to you in this moment?” You know, it feels like you’re failing, at least for me when I just sat there blankly and wasn’t saying anything and wasn't sure what to do. So that could be overwhelming and scary. And for me, having a limited choice of things that I could choose from until I was ready to move out of that really helped me to kind of open up as a player. ",Perception
Perception,"Dungeon Master is sometimes Dungeon Mom, and you just gotta like let them know. , you’ve run a game for all newbies. How did you teach them how to play?"," So this is actually super interesting, because I did run into the same thing where two players really love it, one player liked it but- it’s just different expectations, like Fish what you were saying. So like, what I did in the beginning was I did hold a session zero where I walked though- to be honest I ended up rolling their characters for them and like walking through everything, and I think that was helpful for understanding how all the mechanics work. But I’m a big believer in- and this is just how I learn- like diving in and you sort of learn along the way, but that doesn’t work for everyone, so you have to sometimes run through the mechanics that way. One thing that I’ve heard from other folks is they sometimes give people D&D podcasts to listen to. There’s an abundance of them and they’re all different. So there's ones like ‘Critical Role’ that’s basically just a mic on a table and you hear exactly how things work. There’s things like TAZ, which is very story-focused. Mechanics are minimal. So you can use those to kind of figure out what your players want to do. Do they actually just want to hang out, as Fish said, and eat pizza and drink beer? Those are fun. I’ve had those sessions, like you’re just actually hanging out with this loose reason to get together, but you actually just wanna hang out. Then there's also games where it’s a trust exercise where you’re saying, “We’re entering this room,” like we play on JTP, “We’re entering this room. We’re going to be role playing, open and vulnerable.” That’s hard to get people to trust you to do that. It’s another style of gameplay. But yeah, at the end of the day, everyone’s a newbie at some point, so a little hand-holding isn't so bad, but I do think when you get down to seven sessions, someone’s expectations and someone’s desires are different from what you’re doing, and that’s fine. You just have to figure out how to address those best. Michael",Listen
Perception,"After the first night party, all of you wake up in your beds. How well did you sleep last night? Question is, is P0R0 looking at any of us creepily?"," You can make a Perception check, Inara. ",Perception

Investigation,where the boots came from. Okay. The mud that are on the boots now are the mud from the colosseum. It’s kind of more like a tennis court clay. Mhm.," And these shoes are very, very old. They’re very worn in. I feel like if there was any sort of imprint or like maker name, it’s been like rubbed off. And the material they’re made out of used to be extremely fine leather, but now it’s extremely old and worn in. I would also say with your high enough Investigation check, there’s a part of this left boot that doesn’t fit with the rest of it. It’s like raised near the heel. ",Investigation
Perception,"whistling, sounds of the colosseum with a large crowd] Should I ask it, or do you guys wanna ask it? Go for it. What’s the food situation in this box?"," There’s a whole lotta scrimps.

Athletics,corner them into a corner of the room and then like you know playfully like trying to like bob and weave back and forth Let's do a dexterity contest. 14, Ok they rolled much higher than you.

The best part of making a homebrew D&D campaign is that you can steal from anywhere and the whole time I was looking at Yandu's arrow the one that he controls just by whistling that flies through and just kind of kills everybody. I tried to think of how I could put that in a D&D Campaign. And I figured that it would actually be a performance check. So what I did was I made this thing kind of autonomous and it would go as a bonus action and if you made a performance check or performance role and you beat a certain level it would automatically attack any enemy you wanted. And then they have to do a dex save to save their damage. I also like, it's kind of it's extra like Greg did hold person on Inara and then he sent out the arrow. And Greg is a bard. He's actually a higher level than all of you, he's level four ",Performance

Athletics,"off. It’s 2 Fast, 2 Furious 2 Fantasy. Let’s get the party started. (Theme music) (Slow music plays) Here’s how we’re going to do this chase. You have two sides"," the chasers (that’s you) and the runners, that’s the red throats. With the head start they got, they’re about 100 feet away. I’ve broken down the chase into a certain number of legs, which is a secret. If you reduce the gap to zero before the end of the chase, the runners are caught and the chase ends. Otherwise, the runners escape. Now here’s how the chase works in game play. At the start of each leg, one of you is going to represent your team (and we’ll go around in a circle so everyone gets a shot). I’m going to pick one of the Red Throat. The two characters make an opposed Athletics checks. Who ever wins the check will widens or closes the gap by your speed, so 25 feet. Then, I’m going to roll on this handy dandy Chase Even table. If you rolled an odd result on your the check, the event happens to you. If you rolled an even result, the other side will be hit with whatever is on the table. These can be positive or negative, who knows? I’m going to keep track of the chase mechanics, so you just focus on what gets thrown at you. Got it? (Music stops and crickets chirp) ",Athletics
Acrobatics,"Exactly. Anyway I'm going to throw it at Tracey's rage switch. Make a ranged attack. So six plus five, 11. Yeah you hit it right. And I yell, “Sorry!” (Laughter)", All right. What do you make a acrobatics check just to get up on the stalls. ,Acrobatics

(Laughter)"," Okay. You keep running, and actually you see the landscape start to change. You’re getting farther away from the marketplace and you're now kind of in an open area. And it's turning into like a botanical gardens—there's like fountains and trees and some bushes and people jumping around. Inara, why don't you make a acrobatics roll to see if you continue to parkour your way into this new terrain? ",Acrobatics

Perception,see them go through the rest of the gardens and into the narrow streets on the other side and take a left. And they are out of view. (Crickets fade)," Hey, here! Do you know when you’re swimming in the ocean, and you see a big big wave coming toward you, so you hold your nose because you never really learned how not to do that, and you dive down right before the break, and your whole body is suspended in this perfect balance of the wave’s force and your own forward momentum. You’re hanging there, weightless for one brief moment, and when you surface, the wave already broke, and the danger is behind you, and the sea is one big gentle prairie of potential, stretching endlessly before you. This is that moment. Welcome to the midroll. To start out, a huge thank-you to our new patrons, David and Lucia, and our newest Party Legend, Megan! She will be getting every episode two days early, as well as a customized gift, just for her. We wrote some recipes from our characters for Party Legend Seth, including Inara’s Dad’s oatcakes, and it was so much fun to do. Our Patron-only Discord chat room is also going strong! We’re making book recommendations, sharing photos of our recent beach trip, discussing non-D&D RPGs, and more. For as little as $2 you can get in on the fun at patreon.com/jointhepartypod. Everyone is welcome to the party on Twitter and Instagram, where we’re @JoinThePartyPod. Listener Katie has been livetweeting every episode, which we just LOVE. We can’t watch y’all listen to the episodes but we can read your tweets, and it’s a very close second. We’d be stoked if you shared your favorite moment from this episode using #jointhepartypod. AND, speaking of #jointhepartypod, we have a sick giveaway going on right now! And I am so excited to tell you all about it. For the next few days you have a chance to win a very cool D&D hat. It’s the D&D logo, the dragon with the D, in black embroidery on a black snapback, which is very classy. All you have to do to enter the contest is recommend Join the Party to someone! That’s it! Do it on social media, in person, via text, via carrier pigeon--whatever, we don’t care. And once you do, send us proof. Screenshot, selfie, or tag us in whatever post you make. Use #jointhepartypod on Twitter and Instagram, tag us on Facebook, or even email us. And you can enter up to three times with three different recommendations. Three chances to win the very coolest of hats! I love wearing mine on the subway or in the airport, and I keep hoping that someone will look at my head and be like, “You! D&D! Do you have a podcast? Can I listen to it?” and no one’s done that yet, but if we see each other we’ll just give, like, a secret handshake. It’s gonna be awesome. Anyway!

And can I roll any kind of perception or nature to see if I can tell the difference between these two with and without berries? M",Perception

M"," —no, I mean, as part of the character and part of the history! Because all of the actions, and all the players, every roll adds to the story and how the player reacts. You know, like from Charlene and Tracey's interactions, or Johnny B. Goodlight unable to really party down with James the medicine dwarf, these are all things that are now just part of who they are.

And that is awesome! But I also want to raise us all a cup to us, who figured out alternative ways to use the medicine check and the survival check. I mean, those two are really tied together, because it's like, “Oh, I broke my leg because I was running in a river bed and now I need to, like, stabilize something!” Or a survival [check] is, like, “These berries!

As you climb down you do pass, you do pass by an open window. And in the window is sitting, like right on the ledge, is a gargoyle with like three horns. And he is kind of perched, and actually has an open mouth, looking like a very sort of like goofy look that you were not expecting on a gargoyle. And as you're coming down you hear a humming sound.

Perception,"E She was not, but I'd like to think that Fabious was wearing orange crocs. A Was she wearing orange clogs? E Yes. Sure. Yes, yes. Here's the thing though"," that was great, and you roleplayed that great, and I think that was a very smart move to get Charlene out of the way. The thing was is that TR8c is so bad at communicating that you guys were just like futzing around in the courtyard that I had to count what I would think were the seconds, the in-game seconds, that it took you until you actually moved back into the hall. And that was equal to -- what I keep saying I'm aligning the time streams -- that's like equal to you, to Michael and Johnny B not making a good perception check. So neither people were there to, like, immediately hop on everything it was about to pop off. A",Perception
Nature,"appreciate that. I think it made for an exciting turn of events. A But , what would have happened if we were going into the banquet hall in time? E"," I think it’s a combination of two things. One, you would have caught... you two might have caught them before they got all the way to the dais. And then, you, Johnny B, Michael, might have caught them before they got so close to the dais as to being frog-throwing range. Also, for all the monster heads out there, those frogs were Grungs. They come from Volo's Guide to Monsters. They are super poisonous and they have poisonous skin, much like exotic frogs, and they're very brightly colored. Obviously, no one was able to do an arcana or nature check to identify these frog things. M",Nature
Stealth,We legit did not fake those rolls. A We did not. M Those were real. B We got THREE Nat 20s in one episode. A So a Nat 20 is," you have a 20-sided dice as part of your dice set. And when it itself rolls to be at 20 none of the additions from your various, you know, modifiers, that's a Nat 20, that's a natural 20. And when you roll a one, as I did on I think on my stealth check or something, that is a crit fail. M",Stealth
Medicine,"18 and add plus five, so that’s over 20, but that's still not the best possible thing that can happen. A It’s like the ends of the bell curve. M"," I mean, I've had, in a campaign once, someone prayed, a cleric prayed to their god -- sorry, a paladin prayed to their god, rolled a 20, and the god had an ethereal dragon fly through the battle ground, healing all allies and damaging all the enemies. 'Cause that's just what happened. B",Heal
Nature,"wipe if... all the player characters were gonna die if the dragon didn't show up so. A The Deus Ex Machina, yeah. M He rolled a very timely D20. E"," What I love about the D20... some people see that as a flaw in Dungeons & Dragons as an RPG. But I love how much is based on the D20, that there is so much variance. And that, since everything uses it, you are, you might roll a natural 20 on like a basic sort of check. Like what you guys did on your nature check, what you did on the owlbear. It's like I wanted to tell you everything that I had written, and like, extra! It's like ""Nessie is its middle name also. It is Nessie Nessie Nesserson."" B",Nature

Midroll Music"," Hey, it's, . Buying presents is one of my favorite things to do. And, even though it's not actually part of any sort of religious holiday, you know, put into my actual one, the way that Hanukkah kind of accepts that from Christmas is one of my favorite things to do. Finding something that is representative of what a person thinks they like but doesn't even know they like and one buy for themselves or wouldn't even know about it is a joy. It represents that you know them maybe a little bit better than they do or, at least, to some degree. And it's nice. Now, I know a lot of you out there might not like doing this because it's a lot of pressure. But I have faith in you. This is such a wonderful thing to do. And you can make someone feel so good. And I believe you. Welcome to the Midroll. I got you one of those silicone pebble ice things so that you can make more drinks. I know you'd like that. Hello to our new patrons; Bailey, Grant, Elise, Jeff, Jenny. Soshell, Heather, Laura, Teeva, JayPaul90, Flo, Feyo, Angie, Charlotte, and Simon. We'd like to thank every single one of our supporters on Patreon. You truly make it possible for this to be our jobs, especially in 2020, which is ending. And 2021 isn't going to be all that different all from that. So, we still need your support and thank you. We love talking to you every day on our Discord. We can get pics of dogs that are shaped like bagels and cat that are shaped like loaves on the daily. There's also bonus content from this campaign and Campaign I, including exclusives like the Join the Team miniseries, which is wrapping up very, very soon. If you want to hear me and three of our wonderful podcast friends play a game that I invented with Mischa Stanton about high school drama and football, you need this now. If you're able, join for as little as $5 a month at patreon.com/jointhepartypod. And, if you haven't checked your Patreon for a while, please do so. We made tiers, like, a while ago and a lot of you are still on the old ones. So, if you're still on the old ones, you're not getting those sweet, sweet rewards. Come on, patreon.com/jointhepartypod. I want to tell you about a wonderful thing that I wrote with our very own Schifini in a special Join the Party-Spirits crossover event, The Cool Cryptid Compendium. This is a system agnostic manual with stats and descriptions of 20 different creatures from folklore from around the world. D&D is built around monster slaying, but, a lot of the time, you don't want to kill the monster. And what even makes a monster in the first place? Why should we build adventures around killing it for glory in gold? So, in the Cool Cryptid Compendium, these creatures are, like, strange and wondrous NPCs you can put in to dot your world. They have likes and dislikes, personalities and goals. They are complex and require more than hacking and slashing to interact with. No matter what gaming system you use, you'll get inspiration for these characters that are way more than just a big bad. This would be perfect to slot into a monster of the week campaign. Or you need a fun mythical NPC or villain for your mass campaign, it would work anywhere. It's also so beautiful with the illustration and design by the lovely, Zoe Polando Ryder. You got to check this out. It’s gonn be wonderful for you or all of your monster-loving friends that you would get them for their holiday fun. That is at, exclusively, jointhepartypod.com/merch. We are sponsored this week by BetterHelpw a secure online counseling service. Here's the thing. That bone witch, the one that rolls the bones with the bird bones and all that, she just doesn't understand what I'm talking about. I'm trying to talk about my lived experience. How some people don't – aren't validating and I really need that. And I'm just really in a tough spot right now. And she just keeps rolling the bones and say, “A blood moon is going to come.” And I need something else. That's why I'm turning to BetterHelp. They connect you with licensed counselors through the secure app, letting you message with your therapist, and schedule life phone or video sessions. You can also message your counselor in between sessions if you're worrying about something or if you think of a topic you want to cover in your next call. Instead of just like waiting for the middle of the night and lighting some candles and maybe the bone witch will show up. Who knows? BetterHelp wants – BetterHelp wants to help you find the best therapeutic match possible. It is easy and free to switch counselors if you need to.

Their website has a staff pick section. They can help you find new stuff too. Like, if there's a board game that, like, needs to be not too dark but not too hard and maybe it's, like, set in a forest, you might be able to find that there. I wonder if that exists. I'm actually not even sure. So, head to twentysided.com to check out all they have to offer. And, when you do, remember to use the code JOINTHEPARTY for 20 percent off your online order.

And, best of all, in my mind, it's flexible. So, if you need to add something extra, change dates, skip a week, it's super easy to do.

My favorite thing is that you can choose the color of your product, which is amazing, but also the scent and the strength of that scent. I sneeze whenever I smell perfume or scented candles.

My favorite thing is that you can choose the color of your product, which is amazing, but also the scent and the strength of that scent. I sneeze whenever I smell perfume or scented candles. So, it's so nice to, for once, get a scented product that is very mildly smelling of citrus or Eucalyptus and it does not make me sneeze. Have you ever sneezed in the shower? It's terrible. So, what are you waiting for? Go to functionofbeauty.com/jointheparty to take your four-part hair profile quiz and save 20% on your first order. That's a functionofbeauty.com/jointheparty for 20% off and to let them know that you heard about it from our show. And they should keep sponsoring us. That's a functionofbeauty.com/jointheparty. And, finally, we are sponsored by HelloFresh. They help you save time and money by delivering easy-to-make recipes right to your door. They also have a huge variety of options every week, which helps me to break out of my cooking rut of the same two or three dinners that I repeat a lot. I recently really enjoyed their toasted coconut tempura shrimp, which is one of those meals I might feel intimidated to try on my own. But it was really easy to follow along with their recipe card, which also has photos. It's very helpful. They've also donated over 3.5 million meals so far in 2020. And they offer customers a chance to buy meals for people in need during the checkout process, which I think is great.

But the thing about humans and what we learn from Dungeons and Dragons is that they're resourceful, and they're resilient, and they get great feats. So, I think that we're going to, ultimately, be okay, but the responsibilities that we just need to be nice to each other. And remember that it's not about whether or not you get sick. It's about whether or not the people around you do and you're being considerate to others. Ultimately, it's okay. Also, all of the TV show, Slings & Arrows, which is about Shakespeare and Ghosts is on YouTube. And there's a really young Rachel McAdams in it. So, you should just watch that. Welcome to the Midroll. First of all, thank you to everyone who has joined our Patreon; I Am Renegade, Scarleto, Kylie, Sue, , Brooke, Hunter, Austin, Zoe B., Elizabeth, and My Moon. You're just in time, because we're doing something special for the start of Campaign 2, The Join Campaign. To immortalize everyone who's decided to support art that they love with their human dollars, we're going to read the name out of every single Join the Party patron in the credits of Episode 1 of Campaign 2. That's right. That's everyone. That means anyone who is an active patron on March 31st, 2020, both our current crew and anyone who joins the next couple weeks, we'll get their name immortalized in the credits of the first episode of Campaign 2. So, join by March 31st at patreon.com/jointhepartypod for access to our patron-only Discord, bonus material for both campaigns, and even early access to episodes. That is patreon.com/jointhepartypod.

That's $5 discount with the code, JOINTHEPARTYDC. I also want to tell you about Multiverse. I found out about Multiverse on Twitter late last year. And I have to tell you I'm so excited that the kickstarter launch is today. Multiverse is an online gaming platform dedicated to making gaming more intuitive, more inclusive, and more accessible. That sounds like us. Their tools make it as easy as possible to make play, stream, and share tabletop role playing games with the marketplace for creators. You can build with Pixel art, both on PC and mobile. You just jump into your next adventure with friends, whether across the table or across the world in just a click. That means you can do battles on screen, which is super cool. Their library of combat animations and effects let you play out exactly what's happening onscreen. You can even stream on Twitch. So, everyone gets to see everything that you're doing. So, check out their kickstarter running through April 17 using the link in the episode description. They're also at playmultiverse.com. Okay. We'll see you next week with our last Pregame Episode, The City. We’ll have a little treat for you in the following week. So, look out for that. But, until then, on April 7th, Campaign 2 officially begins. But, for now, let's get back to the world building. Theme Music ",Jump
Intimidation,"Jack of all trades sort of thing or does non-combat important things. So, when you're talking about a face, a face is the person with the highest charisma -- Mhmm.", -- who roles the persuasion checks and the intimidation checks and all that stuff.

Persuasion,"Bard who is too busy like fucking everything to remember how to do spells. Gross. Yeah, I hate bards. Bards suck. Hate bards. Love monks. That's my DM-ing peeve. Hmm."," So, that's a ideal five-person party. Four-person party, you can kind of drop the face or the wild card. Maybe that gets rolled into somebody else. You have a very charismatic fighter. So, maybe you might have, like, more of a knight character. Or maybe your cleric has a lot of persuasion. Or maybe you do have a rogue, who kind of does damage. And maybe you have that wild card and also they are responsible for all of the public interactions that you have. So, for a three-person party, I think that the tank or the punchy person are usually the same. You have one person who's upfront if you're fighting. You need a support person, which is our problem with the first season of Join the Party. You kind of need a cleric or a druid who can, like, buff other people. And then you might have a wild card. I wanted all of you to think about what sort of class archetype you are. And then maybe we can really make sure we distribute. So, we have a punchy person or a tank. And we have a damage dealer. And we have support. I think everyone should do one at a time – like each person does one and we’ll go around in a circle, because, really, this is like our ideation session. ",Persuasion

Or maybe, like me, you have a pair of boots that you bought with your first paycheck ever, and you only break out for real, really special occasions.

So, you can join the Discord, get your name entered in the pool of possible NPC names, or get a physical box of fun RPG stuff, not to mention enjoy two and a half years’ worth of bonus content from the Party Campaign. and I went through all of the NPC stories from before, and I wrote some pretty fun ones!

Now, everyone knows that Dungeons & Dragons is all about storytelling. It’s all about feelings. But did you know that there’s also some math involved?

And our newest sponsor, Brilliant, is also there to give you a toolkit and a framework to work through novel problems. They offer a wide range of content, including interactive courses on topics from scientific thinking to math fundamentals, from programming with Python to machine learning, including probability courses involving dice! Just like Dungeons and Dragons! And they know, just like a good DM does, that you can develop skills and intuition by problem-solving. Effective learning is active learning, and Brilliant lets you master concepts by solving fun, interactive problems yourself.

And I have been waiting for weeks to tell you how into Masks I am. For those of you who don’t know, Masks is a very good game. You play as a teenaged or young adult superhero, and it is probably the best way that the form of the game has followed the function, because it’s powered by the Apocalypse system, so you use playbooks. So you get things you can do, but your superpowers aren’t necessarily like actions. So you know in Dungeons & Dragons everything you do is an action, but like if you were a super strength hero, then throwing someone thirty feet across a park would not be an action, it’s just like a thing you can do. Also it focuses a lot more on the emotional toll of superhero stuff, which is my favorite part of superhero media, especially because you're a teenager or young adult and you have lots of that. In my game that I’m playing with and our friends from Tabletop Potluck, I’m playing a social media star named Wyvern who has dragon wings, and he’s famous for ripping off his personal from a fantasy series, and it’s very fun and I’m having a lot of fun. So, you can go get the Masks book or any other RPG book at 20 Sided Store in Brooklyn, NY. And you can also use jointheparty - all one word - for 20% off in store and online. So go, get Masks.

But I do want some kind of middle, where it’s not like an immediate threat where I must hide some Superman identity from my neighbors, but the world doesn't really know how to deal with this.

I think to determine how much you get roll either Study or Survey. This won’t be a roll where there’s gonna be negative consequences. It’s almost a gather information roll. Josie,Gather Information
Investigation,"my former employer. Believe me, Jeren. I don’t know how to make you believe me, but we’re friends. Rhi (as Jeren) You’ve got a weird idea of friendship, Myra. Rhi"," He goes to start to stand. At this point, you’re gonna need to make a roll. This is partly your gather information roll. You’re gonna be at lesser effect with him, so even if you get a 6, the best you’re gonna be able to get out of him is standard information. But this is also going to be, basically, if you get a 3 or below, he’s gonna leave. Minna",Gather Information
Investigation,gave you? Minna I think she probably has. I think she would have done it when she got to her own room and she could read it in privacy. Rhi," Yeah. Basically, that was the payoff of your gather information check with Jeren. Jeren’s information includes the full name of the owner of The Centuralia Club and the person who was giving the orders to attack The Gondoliers. His name is Harvale Brogan. There isn’t a ton of information that Jeren was able to get that you don’t already have. He bought The Centuralia Club about six years ago. The ownership of the club has always been kept mysterious; it’s part of the general air of the place, is that getting to meet the owner or know the owner is another one of those status markers. So most people don’t know. And now you guys do. Minna",Gather Information

Investigation,see if I can find anything that’s directly related to either The Bluecoats or The Spirit Wardens to see which group is the one that’s actually doing the stopping. Rhi," Oh, okay.

Madge"," So, I think Phin is back at the fight pits. That’s usually where she goes. She has really taken a beating over the past couple days while this has been going on and going horribly, while everyone else is doing their stuff. The way that she stands is she’s obviously keeping her weight off of her twisted ankle, but as she fights it gets really obvious that something isn’t as controlled anymore, like she doesn’t pull punches, she is very precise and direct about landing punches where she knows it’s going to hurt after the fight. She’s fighting with the same guy that she had been up against a couple sessions ago that had totally knocked her flat, but this time now that she’s up against him again it’s going a very different way. The action follows the fight for a couple rounds I think, and then Phin knocks this guy down and she like jumps on top of him and keeps punching him, and doesn’t stop until she’s pulled out of the ring.

Investigation,handful on the first floor and none on the second floor and third. There are a couple guards standing outside the door. Minna And that’s the only way in? Rhi," This is just as you guys first approach; that’s what you guys are able to see.

Chris",Gather Information
Investigation,"the desk are kind of rotted and weak, and they are gonna start to give way under you while you’re searching. Madge Okay. that’s a 3. [into hands] Hubris! Rhi"," So, this was controlled, so what happens is you start opening drawers and sort of feeling around, and you move the chair out to the side and step in, and the floorboards kind of splinter under your foot. You know that it’s like okay, I could either risk it and keep searching and hope I find something, or I can back off and hopefully not cause this to completely collapse. Madge",Search
Athletics,"let’s do that. [laughs] Josie Yeah. Rhi To specify what the consequence was of that bad roll, I’m going to be starting a clock for— Josie Place burns down? Rhi"," Yeah, “the house goes up in flames”, and we’ll make that a 6. So, you guys run to the study. You can either just jump and take level 1 harm, or you can make some kind of roll to climb down more carefully but it’s gonna take a little more time, and you still have this thing coming up behind you setting everything on fire. Madge",Climb

Investigation,"middle of the room is a large stone slab that’s at about a 45-degree angle. It’s pained with arcane runes and there are leather restraints. Kim [gasp] Ooh, okay. Rhi"," Like, hanging open. The floor and the ceiling below and above the slab are also painted with runes. You can also see off to one side there’s a small table. It holds some bottles, some papers, some tomes. You’re standing in such a way that you can’t see the door, and, physically, you turn a little bit to look, and there’s a little bit of a delay, but your vision slowly shifts—not at the same rate that your head turns, but it kind of drifts, turning—and behind you is the door. It seems like you are able to move with this a little bit. This’ll be, basically, your Gather Information roll to see what else you can find out. You could do Attune, you could do Survey, you could do Study. It just depends on how you wanna approach. Kim",Gather Information
Investigation,"of payment, and you all shall enter through the guard passage. Rhi You’ll need to get the uniforms first. Josie Let’s get those. Those are pretty important. Madge Mhmm. Rhi"," Okay. What I’m thinking, then, is I’ll have you guys do a group Gather Information check. You’ll all pick whatever action you’re gonna do. The result of that Gather Information will determine what you’re able to get out of this uniform theft. Madge",Gather Information
Investigation,"risky roll for you. Myra, what do you want to attempt? Minna If Phin’s gonna press on, I think Myra’s going to take her cue and also press on. Rhi"," Okay. Then Phin, go ahead and make roll to continue searching, but it is gonna be risky. Madge",Search
Athletics,"and as many people as you can drag along with you are able to get to the polls. Now then, let’s get started. Shall we? ## Story Continues [00304] Rhi"," We open basically where we left off last time with this massive fire burning in the middle of The Docks right around the Ink Row district where newspapers and tattoo parlors and apartments and other businesses are all crowded together. We see this massive fire consuming buildings. There is a huge crowd of people in the street being held back by a line of Bluecoats. The wagons of The Brigade are rushing back and forth from the fire to the canals carrying water to try and get the fire contained. Duskwall is a very crowded city, there’s not a lot of space between buildings, and a fire like this if it’s not controlled quickly could very easily spread and take out an entire district, and if it jumps any of the canals then it could put the entire city in danger, so there’s a lot of very frantic activity trying to get this blaze under control. We see The Magpies having all just rolled out of bed and rushed over here at the edge of the crowd. What are you doing as you get there? Madge",Jump
Perception,start with the little ones and then you build up to the big ones. Kim (as Blaire) Okay.

Investigation,"too good. Rhi Lani gives you a big smile, reaches over and pats your hand, and then signs back. Rhi (as Lani via Roxanne) Thank you. That’s very sweet. Rhi"," Yeah. The two of them are gonna head out, looking like they’ve got a little bit more of a spring in their steps. As they’re leaving they’re signing back and forth to each other very quickly and making plans. The way that Experts work, since this is the first time we’re doing this, they are able to accomplish certain tasks for the crew independently, which basically means I roll their quality. An Expert is quality equal to your current crew tier +1. It’ll be 2d6. I’ll just roll 2d6 to see how well they do. It’s basically a fortune roll. It’s gonna take them a little while before they get back to you with information. do you all want to try to do any Gather Information checks before they get back to you, or do you want to wait and see what they find out, and then base your Gather Info checks on that? Minna",Gather Information
Investigation,stuff than I do. Would there be some kind of way of telling if the person they belonged to… Kim (as Blaire) Uh… I don’t know! Let’s find out! Kim, Blaire is gonna put on her spirit mask. I would like to roll Attune for my Gather Information. Rhi,Gather Information
Investigation,"think that you are probably able to hear the shooting that has started. It is up to you. Kim Okay. Have I found anything in the meantime, or no? Rhi", Go ahead and make some kind of roll for your searching of this place to see if you found anything. Kim,Search
Stealth,"Josie I feel like we shouldn’t do his office. Because that’s too obvious. Minna Slid into some books on the mantel or something. Josie Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Rhi"," Okay. So yeah, I think I need another roll for you sneaking to wherever you’re going to hide the books – or finding a suitable hiding place, you can roll either one. Minna",Hide
Performance,"bluff pretty well. Rhi Yes you can. Josie I kinda wanna know more about these circus performers. Like, I wanna know when a big event is happening. Kim Yeah. Rhi"," Okay, that you don’t have to roll a Gather Info check for. There are just flyers around, advertising. Because like, they want people to know when they’re performing because that’s how they make their money. Like, people will leave them tips and stuff. You learn that kind of the next big performance is happening in two days. Josie",Performance

Perception,"got at their hip. Rhi (as Crow) Yeah, don’t worry about it. Josie All right. I think we head towards The Docks next, maybe? Minna Yeah, along Cinder Street. Rhi"," So, generally I’m not supposed to call for specific rolls as the GM, but whatever, I’m doing it anyway. Can I get, since this is Gather Info you all can decide whether you want to do it as a group or not, but some kind of perception, noticing things, looking around type roll from whoever would like to do that as you’re making your way up this street? Minna",Perception
Investigation,"roll for investigating the thing, or sneaking, however you want to approach it. I just need some sort of roll so I know how much info to give you. Josie"," Okay. I’m rolling Prowl, but this is still a Gather Information? Rhi",Gather Information
Perception,"Kim [giggles] Rhi Blaire, you don’t have enough jars for this. Kim But I might have enough ectoplasm. Rhi No~ Minna [nervous noises] Kim The spirit well is nearby? Rhi"," You can make a roll to see if you can spot anything, but remember, spirit wells are McDonalds, you all are perfectly cooked steaks. Minna",Spot
Stealth,"see if there are any already existing hidden compartments. Rhi Okay, yeah. That’s a good call. Josie No. Rhi Oh, yeah, okay. Josie So behind the altar it is. Rhi"," Yeah, I think that that was, since in this position it’s controlled, if you wanna hide it you’d have to try a different approach, or you can just be like, ‘Well, I will just set it down on the ground back here’. Josie",Hide
Medicine,"swing just cracks you upside the head. So you’re going to take level 2 harm. Josie I’m going to resist that. Rhi Okay, that’s gonna be Prowess. Josie Critical. Rhi"," Okay. So, I don’t know if this has happened yet. When you roll a critical on a resistance roll, not only do you take no stress, you actually heal a point of stress! Kim",Heal
Stealth,"a normal load. Kim Normal as well. Rhi How about you? Minna I said yep, which meant normal. Rhi Okay. Minna Boy, I am stressed out about this score~ Rhi"," Engagement roll~ Obviously this is, I’m assuming, a Stealth score? Kim & Josie",Stealth
Nature,"the stress, and the reason you take additional stress is because you’re gonna see something extra. Josie I can’t turn that down. Rhi [laughs] Josie Like, I can’t. [laughs] Rhi"," Excellent! You’ll make an Attune roll. It’s basically a Gather Info roll, so there’s not gonna be any consequences, but you are going to take stress just because of the nature of this item. Kim",Nature
Athletics,"Minna Silently. Josie (as Minx) Back to the drawing board. Rhi So, what is Plan B? Josie Uh… well. I think Plan B is going around the outside now. Rhi"," [laughs] So, I think you fall back a couple cars and are able to find one of the hatches that the Rail Jacks use. So, this’ll probably be, like, there will be a series of rolls as you’re navigating down the train. If you do not have climbing gear, like, each of you would need to mark climbing gear, if you don’t, it’s gonna be desperate. If you do mark climbing gear you can hook yourselves onto the train and it will just be risky. Josie",Climb
Stealth,"time to say goodnight. Josie And she’s gonna blow out our lantern. Kim Oh. Rhi [laughs] Okay. Josie And try and pull everyone down to, like, hit the deck. Rhi"," Okay. That’s gonna be some sort of roll. So, you’re trying to basically hide where you all are, trying to kind of… right? Josie",Hide
Nature,"Rhi So, like, if you are trying to impersonate a teller you’ll be at improved effect. Okay, so yeah, Minx knows how banks work. Kim Vaguely. Rhi Yeah. Vaguely. Kim"," I want to roll a Study to see if Templesmith bank has any, you know, ghost wards or electroplasmic locks, stuff of that nature. Rhi",Nature
Athletics,"near where we want to make it happen, and you know, we just pull off to the side of the road like any… Rhi Yeah, like you’re supposed to. Josie"," …any car with sirens behind it, yeah, and just wait for it to roll right past us until we’re at the point where we want to climb on. Rhi",Climb
Insight,"rushes over and holds out a hand, but she locks eyes with you, not Wester. Minna Oh shit. Rhi So you can do with that information as you like. Minna", [under her breath] Is there some kind of insight roll? [laughs] I’ve been playing too much D&D. Rhi,Insight
Acrobatics,"to somehow get control of the boat. Minna I can, uh… Rhi Because this lady is not in on your plan! [laughs] Minna Vial of slumber essence and Skirmish. Rhi"," Yeah. Yeah. You can knock her out. I’m gonna give you controlled on this, because she’s not expecting you to attack her. She thinks you’re some poor, probably strung out on drugs waif who tumbled over the side into the— Josie",Tumble
Perception,"door unlock as someone has finished a session and is going to be walking their client out. Josie Well, that’s behind us. We can duck around the corner, right? Rhi"," Yes, but the risk is that you’re going to get seen. Basically it’s kind of reduced effect in that you did not make it all the way to the place you need to get. You’ll need to make another roll to get to the lounge area, and then there’s a possibility that you’ll get spotted by these people. Josie",Spot
Insight,"but Myra, I’m not sure that you necessarily do. Minna [nervous, uneasy noise] Rhi Actually, I’m gonna have you make a resistance roll. Minna I was gonna say, I’m… Rhi", Yeah. Roll me an Insight here. Minna,Insight
Investigation,alerted that there are some kind of intruders on the third floor. Minna I guess climbing in a window was not my smartest move knowing there’s a security system. Rhi," [laughing] Listen, Nyryx didn’t leave you a lot of options. You’re up there, and while that’s all happening we’ll cut back upstairs. Blaire, go ahead and give me a roll to search the hallway that you’re in. Kim",Search
Investigation,"her sword in the other hand. She’s not being very thorough, she’s just kind of going for the end and if that’s not it she’ll work her way back. Rhi", Okay. Go ahead and give me a roll for searching this end of the hall. Josie,Search
Insight,"hat Productions. Rhi Next, I’d like to thank our splendid Patreon backers. Mark Williams, thank you! XYXLOC, thank you, and sorry I couldn’t pronounce your name. ## Blooper [04531] Rhi", And you’re gonna need to make an Insight check here. Minna,Insight
Insight,"backers. Mark Williams, thank you! XYXLOC, thank you, and sorry I couldn’t pronounce your name. ## Blooper [04531] Rhi And you’re gonna need to make an Insight check here. Minna"," [amused] An Insight check, huh? Rhi",Insight
Insight,"thank you, and sorry I couldn’t pronounce your name. ## Blooper [04531] Rhi And you’re gonna need to make an Insight check here. Minna [amused] An Insight check, huh? Rhi"," Err, an Insight—not Insight check, uh, an Insight resistance roll. [giggling] Josie",Insight
Insight,"Rhi And you’re gonna need to make an Insight check here. Minna [amused] An Insight check, huh? Rhi Err, an Insight—not Insight check, uh, an Insight resistance roll. [giggling] Josie", [mockingly] I roll to Sense Motive. [laughter] Rhi,Sense Motive
Investigation,"getting the wrong idea. Rhi Is there anything else you wanna ask Briggs before he heads out? Minna Are there any, like, rivals of Nuncio that he knows about? Rhi", Um… let’s do some kinda Gather Information roll for that. Minna,Gather Information
Stealth,"of the crime, and do some ghost field inspection. Rhi Yeah. Yeah, um, I think… I’m gonna have you— so, I’m gonna have you make two rolls. Kim Okay. Rhi", One of those rolls is gonna be the actual Gather Information roll and the other roll is gonna be for kinda how stealthy you can be while doing this. Kim,Stealth

Stealth,and snatch it from them. On their way out. Kim (as Blaire) Let them do the work for us. Josie (as Minx) Yes. Kim (as Blaire) I like it. Rhi, I think the first roll that I’m gonna need here is for you all to hide well enough. Josie,Hide
Investigation,"to lift some books that aren’t on your list— Minna You know, why risk it? Rhi Yeah, there is a possibility that you would get caught. Kim Okay, true. Rhi"," So yeah, you can— this is gonna be a controlled position and you can make whatever rolls you want to start searching the place. Minna",Search
Athletics,"Kim (as Blaire) Sounds like a plan. Rhi All right. So, the plan is to climb up to the roof, try and deal with this…? Kim Yep. Josie Mm-hmm. Rhi"," Okay. So yeah, I think I’m gonna need a roll for climbing up to a roof. Josie",Climb
Investigation,"am gonna take you up on that walk. Anything you want me to grab you? Minna (as Myra) No, I should be okay, thank you. Rhi (as Jeren) Alright. Rhi"," I think he kinda, you know, stands up and rolls his shoulders back and will make his way out. And I think Myra may not see this, but he kinda, like, starts to glance at the book you’re reading and then, like, very pointedly makes himself look away. And he will slip out the door and leave Myra to her research. So, from the library we fade out and then fade back in on Nyryx’s apartment. So, my mind went to Nyryx is in a robe with her hair down… [laughs] Josie",Search
Athletics,"Did you want— Josie No, I should roll again. I wanted it to be increased effect. Rhi Increased effect? Okay. Josie Yeah. Let’s just start fresh. Still a 6. Rhi"," [laughs] Alright, it’s meant to be. That was an even better roll. Okay, so in that case I think you’re able to just, like, jump on one of them, and I don’t think that you, like, kill them outright, but you’re able to stab them in such a way that they’re incapacitated. Josie",Jump
Performance,"to defeat a hull. How many ticks did you have left on that? Minna Uh, I think I only had one. Rhi Yeah, that’s what I thought. Minna Yeah. Rhi"," So, this is gonna complete that. You— the piece that you are missing, because all of these things that you found about hulls didn’t explain kind of how the spirit actually is bonded to the hull. That information is really tightly controlled by the Spirit Wardens, and by the Archive of Echoes. So, how the spirit is contained, or is bound to the hull. It is contained within a soul vessel, which is a memento from the spirit’s life. It’s something that this person cared about when they were alive. In order to destroy the soul vessel, you have to kind of get ahold of the vessel. A ritual has to be performed to reverse the wards that are binding the spirit to the vessel, then you can shatter the vessel and it will release the spirit. That’s how you stop a hull. Josie",Perform
Stealth,"for the engagement roll. Waffles Nice. Kim Woo! Awesome. Rhi I have never done that. Let me see what this says. Kim Oh my God, we have blessed energy. Rhi"," You’ve already overcome the first obstacle, and you’re in a controlled position for what’s next. So, the two of you head down along the canal into the catacombs. And you’re actually able to kind of move in very quickly. You’re able to catch up with Malista. As you’re following her, you see some light starting to fill the catacombs and you see her reach an archway where there are a couple lanterns hanging and a pair of people standing blocking this archway. And she gets up to them and says something and they step aside and kind of incline their heads respectfully as she passes and then block it again. And so, Blaire, you’re just kinda like, “Uh, okay,” you look around and you’re like, “Oh, I know exactly where we are, there’s totally a way around.” So you backtrack a little bit and go through this other side hallway and you have to kinda crawl through a spot where the ceiling’s collapsed a little bit, but you’re totally able to just loop around the guards at the front of this little area of the catacombs. You crawl through and come up to another archway where you can see light kind of filtering through. You both creep up to this archway and peer out, and you see— I’ll put this to you two. What would be, of kind of a cultist hideout, what would be the most advantageous place for you to enter? Kim",Hide
